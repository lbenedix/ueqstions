I was wondering well how could i achieve that upwards  acceleration, counteract gravity and then some. I thiugh of spaceships but that requires fuel. But rubber ducking to you now i realize perhaps some sort of bernoulli effect but i think i cant have bernoulli effect when the incoming wind is in the desired lift vector. Perhaps a winglike thing on the ball but have it be engineered so that the addon itself converts it to upwarda motion. I have no idea how to change a lift vector. You got any ideas?

        "q": "You responded to a question about tuning systems a while back. The asker wanted to know if you'd ever tried tuning completely in just intonation. You said it's a noble endeavor, but ultimately it's impossible; you couldn't even get a full major scale out of the harmonic series, much less a working system of chromatic harmony.<br/><br/>I've realized something which could go a long way towards solving this problem - I've even composed/arranged some nice music using this concept. (It is by no means my original idea, btw.)<br/><br/>Your problem was that you tried to create a major scale (C major, if I recall) in which each scale degree was only tuned one way, regardless of its 'function'. For example, F would always be the same pitch, whether it was the 3rd of a D minor chord or the 7th of a G7 chord.<br/><br/>The way I started thinking about just intonation tuning is this: all harmony diatonic to C major can be derived from the harmonic serie s of Bb  (minus 4ข, because C, in this case, is defined as the 9th harmonic of Bb).<br/><br/>In the C overtone series, we can get a very nice version of the C major triad (1st, 3rd, and 5th harmonics), the G major triad (3rd, 9th, and 15th harmonics), the E minor triad (3rd, 5th, and 15th harmonics), and the B diminished triad (15th, 9th, and 21st harmonics).<br/><br/>In order to get the three remaining triads, you need to use some 'undertones' of C - notes for which C is an overtone. I thought about it like this - if we get C major and E minor triads from the C harmonic series - we can just transpose down a (harmonic) perfect fifth to get F major and A minor triads. Then we can transpose down another perfect fifth to get the D minor triad (3rd, 5th, and 15th harmonics of Bb).<br/><br/>Since F-2ข and C are both overtones in the Bb-4ข harmonic series, and since each overtone has a harmonic series of its own (which is still part of the original harmonic series), we can say that a ll harmo ny diatonic to C major can come from the Bb-4ข overtone series and sound great.<br/><br/>However, to sound good, notes need to be tuned differently depending on what member they are in a chord. For example, the D minor triad in C sounds great on its own when tuned as the 3rd, 5th, and 15th harmonics of Bb-4ข. But the D minor triad can also be found within a G9 chord. In this case, a different tuning will be way more consonant - as the 3rd, 7th, and 9th harmonics of G+2ข (which is the 3rd harmonic of C and the 27th harmonic of Bb-4ข). If I remember correctly, this is how you tried to tune a D minor triad a while back - it sounds consonant in the context of a G9 chord, but not in the normal context of a D minor chord.<br/><br/>I realize this is not so practical for live keyboard or fretted instruments, but it's been great for retuning recorded music or composing in a DAW.<br/><br/>Thoughts?"

Dropping the schedule feels like freedom. (I'm also pretty tired from making content daily, so I love the idea of a change of pace.) On the other hand, I haven't been off-schedule in a long time, and the schedule itself gave me the initial jolt of energy I needed to get going, so I fear the lack of direction/motivation that (sometimes) comes from having no schedule. <br/><br/>You've done all sorts of schedules and non-schedules... any advice?"

See Cgmatter's youtube page for tutorial. But you just render an image and plug it into the denoise node in the composite space and then render and its removes the noise. Eevee still is definitely the way to go and there are plenty of other more important things to learn but i just tried this recently and it really is quite spectacular looking imo so its just something to remember"

I used 5-digit groups for the first hundred, but after that I found it was better to use variable-length groups -- easier to make up a story around them, harder to mix up the order, and so on.<br/><br/>What's weird if I memorized them in my native language, which is not English, and it's really hard for me to recite the decimals in English. I have to pronounce them in my native language and translate the digits into English on the fly, which is hard to do at the same time. I memorized the sounds of the numbers, not the numbers themselves. I never decided to do that, it's just how I naturally did it. I wonder if other people memorized the shapes instead, and would have an easier time saying them in a different language by just visualizing the numbers instead of having to pronounce them internally.<br/><br/>I'm not a musician but I'm curious as to how you learn a song. Probably you  don't ju st recall the specific notes or chords, but some higher-order pattern? Is this something you can explain in simple words?"

Also it may be different if your main instrument is a lead instrument - in that case you might want to know how to read melodies.
