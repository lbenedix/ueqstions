That actually makes me feel a lot better about things. Thank you. Now, here's another thing, do you ever feel like something you're trying to do gets \"lost in translation/adaption\"? Example: I have this amazing short story. One of the best things I've written thus far. There's this playwright competition thing I'm doing for school (two actually). I had this great idea: \"Hey, I'm going to turn that short story of mine into a stage play\" So, I start writing. And ew. In my head the idea worked so well, but on paper it's just not good. It loses all the stuff that made the original so fucking good. It made me kinda resent the story and avoid working on the script but the deadline is rearing it's godawful head and I'm going to have to finish it even though i don't like it and it just isn't what I wish it was. Oh, another thing I hate ab out it.  I'm expected to write a good play but they (the judges i guess) put so many restrictions on it."

However as someone who just wants to know whats going on inside that brilliant brain of yours, it drives me absolutely insane! You so very clearly have ideas you want to  convey a nd messages you want to communicate with everyone, and about 80% of these questions have genuine answers about motivation, attitude and inspiration, all of which are actually GREAT advice!

Because you have a very unique way of making song s that a lways seems to have deep and intertwining themes.

It should come as no surprise to you that I quit taking my meds when I first started following you early this year because I thought \"if he doesn't need them, then I don't either!\"... and how did that turn out? Pretty fucking badly, I guess... right? So maybe just chill the fuck out for a minute and stop trying to convince everyone to get off their meds unless you're actively trying to get people to become creepy obsessive unhinged lovesick psychos when their brain chemistry jumps off the deep end. https://www.reddit.com/r/billwurtz/comments/9h5zc7/whoa/"

Another thing i learned, on the subject of working faster, is, ... work faster. you gravitate toward what matters. and it is so easy to lose your mind if you listen to that damn thing for too long. you'll just lose your mind ...... another way to get tips is watching a billion mixing tutorials and tips videos until you realize they are all starting to contradict each other, and then you forget it and do what you want",
