      {
        "a": "here's what i would do. set the 'make up gain' to zero, just to eliminate confusion. In the early days, i would add compression on the default setting, and it had like 4db of makeup gain on it. so i was assuming it was doing something. but it wasn't enough, because some parts were still too loud/soft. so i still had to do extensive manual adjustments to the volume (not compression, just drawing a line to adjust the volume over time. very tedious, but worth it.) Then one day i finally realized that the compression actually wasn't doing anything, it had just given a 4db boost which tricked me into thinking it was doing something. so maybe get rid of the makeup gain, just so you know what you're dealing with. if your compressor has a visual representation (like a slanted line, etc), that's great. Basically the whole trick is, look at the 'gain reduction' meter. That should be a little light or something that will tell you when it's actually cutting the volume. and it should tell you at each moment how much it is actually reducing the sound. Set your ratio (that's how steep the slant is) set that to maybe..... 2:1? 3:1? it depends on what you're using it for, what instrument, or whatever. that is how slanted it is. Basically 1:1 means it's doing nothing. if you look at the visual representation it should be a perfect 45deg diagonal line. that means it's doing nothing. 2:1 or 3:1 will be less steep. But you should also see a bend in the line..... it will be exactly 45degrees below a certain point, and then it should bend, to be what your ratio is (so probably less steep). Now if you adjust the threshold, it should move that bend point up and down. if you move the bend point down, it means it's squashing more of the sound... like even the quieter parts. If you move the threshold up, it should be doing Less, and only squashing the loudest parts. as you move the threshold up and down, you should notice the gain reduction meter doing more, or less. As you move the threshold down, you should see the gain reduction meter coming on a lot more often, and you'll probably hear what it's doing. you'll hear the sound being squashed-all the loud parts will be squashed down to the same volume as the medium parts (somewhat, depending on the steepness of your ratio). so just adjust the threshold up and down until you get what you want. The trick is, if the gain reduction meter is doing nothing, then you can be sure nothing is happening. so definitely change it until you see some action there, otherwise it's doing nothing. then of course, once you get that right, you'll have to bring up the makeup gain. because it will have made the overall volume mostly lower. that's why presets will probably not work right, because it doesn't know how loud your material is. so you have to play around until you 'find' where the volume levels are on your track, and so it can be acting appropriately to curb the peaks just the right amount. hope that helps",
        "q": "Thank you! That was helpful advice about mixing. So, if I can ask again, is it your preference to do all the settings for compression manually, or to tweak a preset compression? I don't know what type of program you use but are those presets helpful? Anyway, I'm excited to keep learning and improving!"

Check the gain reduction meter to confirm whether it's doing anything. you can check out some tutorials about this i'm sure. Basically what it does is it's like you hired a gnome to very quickly adjust the volume of a track (such as the vocal, or maybe the entire song) in small amounts to prevent the volume from being so all over the place. turns it up when it gets quiet, and turns it down when it gets loud.

    "q": [
      {
        "a": "a mathematical guideline for time signatures, supposedly, is that the top number is how many beats per bar, and the bottom number is what note is a beat. So, by that logic, 2/4 means 2 beats per bar, and a 4th note (quarter note) gets 1 beat. By the same logic, 7/2 (as if anyone ever uses that, which they don't) would mean 7 beats per bar, and a Half note gets one beat. But, here's the thing: usually, in actual reality, when the bottom number is 8, the eighth notes are usually going by too fast to actually 'feel' like a beat. But by the sheer logic of the 'beats' rule as described earlier, 6/8 *would* mean, 6 beats per bar, and the 8th note gets one beat. But, almost always, in actual reality, 6/8 is actually fast enough that it's actually felt as if the dotted quarter note gets the beat. So that would make it 2 beats per bar, and 3 8th notes per beat. So really, to properly follow the system, that would mean your top number should be 2, and the bottom number should be...um.... some kind of decimal (let me perform some calculations)... the bottom number would have to be about 2.6667. So really, in actually reality, the way 6/8 is usually felt, it should more accurately be called 2/2.667. But that would cause chaos all over society, so it's not written that way. But getting back to the difference between 3/4 and 6/8-- if you set your metronome to 120bpm, and count in groups of 3 clicks, let's say that's 3/4 at ♩=120. Now set the metronome to 80bpm, and count in groups of 2 clicks, and subdivide each beat into 3, so like imagine you are counting 8th note triplets in 2/4. 3 triplets per beat, 2 beats per bar. but, plot twist, imagine the small notes are actually 8th notes, and you are living in a universe where there is 3 8th notes per beat, and each beat is a dotted quarter note. This is what it would feel like to be in 6/8, and the tempo marking would be ♩. = 80. In 6/8 (or 12/8) the tempo marking is often marked in terms of a dotted quarter note. So anyway, to conclude, this is not written in any 'rule', but this is just the way it is in the real world -- 6/8, 12/8, and often 9/8, are counted as if the beat is happening on dotted quarter notes. again, the reason being that no one wants to write 2/2.667. And, you may be thinking, why not just put the song in 2/4 and use triplets, or maybe just 4/4, and use triplets. And this is a valid argument, and like i always say, when you are faced with a song with some kind of triplet or quick 3 feel, you just have to ask yourself whether you would prefer to be writing a lot of dots (for all the 'regular' beats which will have to be dotted) OR a lot of the number 3 (for all the triplets). It's a personal decision, and the more you get out there and see the kind of charts that are circulating in your world or community, you can make the decision based on what you think would be most familiar to your reader(s)",
        "q": "Can you explain to me the difference between 6/8 and 3/4? I've always been told, \"yes they look the same but they're not and its important that you know that\" but I've never actually understood what was so different about them other than eighth notes instead of quarter notes. Also, my cat says hello."

Fast forward a few weeks later, during 'song selection' time, for the next song recording, and i had picked my semi-finals from the list, i think it was about 27 semi finalists (from a list of hundreds), and here's where i made a crucial mistake. i thought it would be a good idea to go around again, for a second round of elimination. Turns out that's a bad idea, and this is probably exactly the moment that i learned this. What happened was, i ended up eliminating them all. So, being on a hasty 2-week production schedule at the time, i realized i had but mere moments to spare, i hastily reversed back to the 27 semi-finalists, and out of spite / reverse psychology of some kind, i picked what i felt was the 'weakest' idea in that list. because i was so frustrated at myself for having eliminated all of them in the second round, i just wasn't trusting my 'opinion' anymore, so i just figured whatever is in that list of 27 has already been picked as one that i wanna do, so just to spite myself, i picked 'bad thing' because it was probably one of the least developed (one line) and i was least attached to it. i can't exactly explain my reasoning any other way, other than a bit of frustration and spite. Everything after that, as they say in the gravy business, is gravy. Because with the selection finalized, the remainder of the writing process is inspired by 1 thing only, which is trying to make the best song i can from what i have. which, in this case, since the first line i had was the first line of the song, means playing the first part and just trying to imagine how the next part would go, and so on, from there. heavily relying on my go-to techniques of 'making things up' and 'using my imagination'.",

        "a": "the chorus was written first. i believe there were 2 writing prompts at play there. a random word selection (always 2 words), it was 'campaigning' and 'stress', and also i believe there was also a musical prompt which is to use a 4415 based chord scheme at the top of the chorus. It appears that that song 'selection' occured on the same day as the original idea session. this is common, because when starting a new song process, first i do a series of new idea genration sessions, and then, separate from that, i do a song selection process (where i select which one is recorded) which can include the entire list of all song ideas, not just from that session. But quite often, the newer ones win, because for whatever reason they might be stronger and feel more relevent. So that one was selected, and it certainly was not more than a chorus (i think the chorus was probably fully written at the time of the selection, but nothing else). So, as with the other example, everything that happens after that is just part of the songwriting process, where i know that that's the song i'm doing. so i have to just put in the work to get it where it needs to be. So in this case, it's 'chorus was written first', which is always strange and quite a backwards puzzle to do, especially if you determine that the chorus does not go at the beginning of the song. Often in those cases, the verse solution will arrive melodically first, with almost no lyric. and i think this was definitely the case here, and it seemed to want to be something like \"i still remember the first day that...?' ... or 'i remember the..first..?? something'. I recall rattling around for quite some time trying to find something powerful enough to be the first line. and i believe, as is so often the case, it was in the shower that the actual solution arrived, 'i remember the moment that my dreams were broken.' And from there, as always, it's just the regular forward writing process as usual, trying to figure out the best way for it to go on a moment to moment basis after that",
