But whether we're happy or sad, home is home. Now, if our next chord is what we expect it to be, using a lot of the same notes as the first chord, then that's not much of an adventure. but if all of the sudden we're playing very unexpected notes, that can have this otherworldly vibe. i discovered this by playing a D minor chord followed by a B major. because I've already played the D and the F without making it sharp or flat, you really wouldnt expect me to flip it on it's head and make both the D and the F sharp. so it feels like we've learned something new and extraordinary, especially because the B is Major compared to the unhappy minorness of home. a m i gett ing somewhere?"

But there's also an infinite number of numbers, with an infinite number of subdivisions between each number.... So that's a bigger version of infinity than the subdivisions between 0 and 1? How does that work? How can something be bigger than infinity? If you take all the subdivisions between 0-2, you'd have an infinite number of subdivisions... but the number of subdivisions between 0-1 would be that 0-2 'version' of infinity, divided by 2? You can't divide infinity by 2 can you? I'm confused. Please help?"

I don't know why I became so awkward around her in person, and it really irritates me that I messed up with her, because I really did love her. I just didn't want to come off as clingy and weird in public. I'm kind of a shy and quiet person most of the time, and it takes me a while to warm up to someone and show them the real me. The only reason I didn't show her the love and affection that she deserved in public is because we only really see each other in school, and I didn't want anyone looking at me strangely. I get embarrassed and nervous easily, and I would have been panicking in my head if people looked and laughed at me while I was being affectionate t owards h er. The real issue here is that I still have feelings for her. I miss what we had together. I want to try again and be less awkward around her, but I feel like she'll turn me down this time because she might find someone else or I might fuck it up again. I don't know if I'll ever find a girl like her again. I feel like a hopeless piece of shit. What do I do to make myself feel better in a time like this?

I'm having a real hard time adding parts on top because there's no defined rhythm to use as reference.

One thing I've learned that is really important is that it's how the voice matches with the melody and words... like getting the most out of the style of your voice. Good example I can think of is donald fagen. I can't imagine him belting out freddie mercury tunes or something, but I think he's a great singer because his voice is perfect for his melodies/words. I guess I just need to find my 'character' in my voice?"

Dividing 2 by 1/2 is 4, by 1/3 is 6, etc. In other words, the smaller the fraction, the higher the multiplication. Extrapolating, you can see that dividing by zero is (abstractly) the same as multiplying by infinity. So dividing by zero doesn't give you a real answer because infinity is an abstract concept (whereas numbers are abstract concepts that can have sort-of tangible real-life equivalents). Why don't you ever use capital letters?"

That would be like if you had a camera that saved every picture as \"picture\" by default, and it wiped out any previous picture named 'picture' every time you took a picture without re-naming it. so not only do you have to name your picture every time but you have to remember all the names you've ever used, so as to not risk deleting a picture. i searched and searched and i could not find an explanation for why the program is this way, or just simply how you would go about this without living in a state of mind fucktastrophy. oh and by the way there's no save dialog and it's easy to quit accidentally. so there's that too",

Well, that's the story of my life right now. I have so many ideas and directions I want to go with music that I can't get anything done. Like, the other week I was listening to prelude to the afternoon of a faun and I was thinking how I'd love to learn orchestration and arranging and write these beautiful, epic symphonic poems. But I also LOVE prince and p funk and james brown, and I want to just devote my life to making the funkiest music ever. But I'll watch some of your videos and I love your score-writing and how you sync up music and visuals so well and how that's such a powerful tool and it makes me want to learn animation and video-making. But then I listened to some paul simon, and it's like, maybe I just want to get my acoustic guitar and ju st write  some nice songs. Then I'll hear some top 40 radio and it makes me want to write really fun, upbeat, catchy bubblegum-y tunes. But my first love, the thing that made me want to be a musician was blues, and there's always a part of me that just wants to just be a blues guy... I can go on forever and write a novel about the music I want to make, and I'm being pulled in so many different directions. I'll get really motivated to do something, until I have another idea that makes me pull a 360 and want to do something entirely different. I have all these lofty goals and dreams and things I want to accomplish, but I can't stop time and do everything all at once. More than anything I want to be PROLIFIC. I want a vast library of music. But I can't commit to any one thing because nothing stands out above the rest for what direction I want to go, and what I want to devote myself too. My compass is spinning around. I'll sit at the piano or pick up my guitar to write and can't even foc us on on e thing for more than a few minutes. I'll start working on one thing, and then without even thinking, my brain switches gears and I'll be trying to do something entirely different. Every time I turn on that sink to fill my cup, the water gushes all over the place and I drop the cup and it shatters and I'm left with a spray of water everywhere, but no water in my cup to drink (or to give to others to drink). I've taken a page out of your book and have been really serious about documenting and recording every idea so nothing falls through the cracks... But I just don't know what to do next. Do you have any advice you can share with me? I'm about to explode."
