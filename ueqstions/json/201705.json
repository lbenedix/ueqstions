But they don't choose where they go they just get dragged around by chemotaxis.But then chemotaxis gets really really complicated and the mini robots team up into little groups of robots (by accident) to make eukaryotes and these basically become ultra amazing jellyfish robots and it gets kinda hard to start to see where they're just getting dragged around by chemotaxis and where they're making decisions i mean could you call an insect's behaviour decisions? Then some filler and thanks to some handy processes like evolution and natural selection we get the next gen. supercomputer chemistry that can think and work with other supercomputers to keep doing what it's always done without ever really realising it. Because there was no such thing as realising something. And then the more they work together the smarter they get and eventually the chemistry based supercomputers learn what chemistry is. And then it's weird because the chemical system on a passive level is incredible at chemistry with a super fine tuned system but actively doesn't even understand what chemistry is and is kind of shit at it.  So we're kind of chemistry doing chemistry because it means it doesn't have to deal with random stuff on an even better level and it beats entropy even more extravagantly than it did before - using the passive system, that took billions of years to develop by chance, to move individual atoms and make structures like laptops and abstract  structu res like music that are too statistically unlikely and should never exist but if you go the long way around to making them by starting with bacteria they do.So I'm just a chemical system that become sentient? Is that supposed to mean something? I guess you could even say chemistry had to be made too from more fundamental stuff. Will AI be like the next level after us? cos it's still chemistry just kinda like it realised what it was and instead of waiting for evolution built a better, faster, smarter vessel for itself. If it wants - if we want.So the universe went from having no purpose and just random stuff to having a purpose. Because we want things does that count as purpose?Idk kinda rambley."
