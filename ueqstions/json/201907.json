Take the song 'happy birthday to you' in the key of C. right before the end of the song, on the last \"birth\". the harmony is probably playing C chord, but i think you'll find that the best place for the bass, at this point in the song, is G. i can name a trillion other examples of popular/classic/traditional songs, over the course of the last 300 years, that have had a 1(chord) over 5(bass) absolutely thrive in this right before the end finalistic 'the song's about to end' spot. you've heard it a million times. try putting C over C there instead .... it doesn't quite fit. it sounds like the beginning of the song, .... right before the end ? ... By the way, to complete the example just you you can hear it clearly, the 'good' way to do it, from the final line \"birth\" is C/G, \"day\" is D7, \"to\" is G7sus4, and \"you\" is C, preferably with the G note left out, just e c , with low C in the bass. and Fmin/Ab was on \"hap\"",

Surely your niche opinion on software was not already widely held by that audience; as you had said yourself in what I believe were your initial writings on the matter, you felt that you had held this question subconsciously for a long time before you could express it.

(actually when doing it all in numbers like this i prefer to write the 6 higher than the 5, but that's not always so easy in text, especially plaintext like this, so i don't blame you). another thing, when you have the 1aug, i think it's most likely 1aug7. they're not doing us a favor with the release/cutoff of these chords being so long, the chords are bleeding into each other. Makes that flat5 thing much less effective than it could be, and difficult to identify because if we try to pause and isolate that moment by brute force, it's going to have the previous chord smeared in with it. But for sure plain as day to me that feels like a thing i always use, which would be a 3aug triad over b5 bass note. (not b5dim as you called it) so in this key, Baug/C#. if you listen carefully you can very clearly hear the E note (from the C/D chord)   change to Eb during the chord. also, for more even smaller nitpicks, the 2min on the second line is 2min7. just noticed the first chord at the very top also has a 2 in it. so you might say 1sus2,4. and the 1maj9 on the first line i would definitely call that 5/1 (5 over 1). straight off the yacht",

I've realized that my problems are partially in my head and I've been making excuses, procrastinating, etc...  I know this is partially due to my anxiety problems - and I've heard friends (mostly actors) describe it as \"being in your head\".  <br/><br/>I say all that to tell  you tha t your videos and audio recordings buried on your website that show a glimpse into your creative process - especially when you were starting with Vine - have really helped me and inspired me.  A lot of that stuff made me feel like I wasn't alone and crazy whenever I talk to myself about grand ideas in order to sort things out or I try to hype myself up to get some creative endeavor done.<br/><br/>Is there any advice you can impart that'll encourage me to do \"the damn thing\"?

It basically goes like this: \"a tuplet/grouplet is a group o f multip le shorter notes used as a substitute for a single longer note (for example a group of 3 eighth notes can be used instead of a single quarter note)\" . Does my definition make any sense? How would you explain tuplets in your own words? What's the most important thing to know about tuplets?
