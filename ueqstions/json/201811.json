Because we are a small spark of self-consciousness in what appears to be a never-ending expanse of lifelessness. There is all of this stuff here, but it's so far apart in all of this nothingness. It doesn't matter, because we are so small, and yet it's the only thing that matters because we the planets are all that really exist. Going around stars that give us heat and energy and life and brought us into this world and keep us safe in their gravity wells. This solar system is our playground and we're both spoiling and squandering it. So many beautiful worlds that we could get to know. The things we aren't doing could save us from our eventual demise, and the things that we are doing are speeding it up. We are trapped on this planet by our own ineptitude and our own inability to just be cool to one another and try to think ab out how  cool the universe is. That's why I like you. You make music that's chill and gets people thinking about how cool shit is. I want to help make more people think about the universe before it's too late because they've just been thinking about themselves. I feel lost and confused and don't know how to start. I tried some stuff but it just got me in trouble and I lost my job because apparently music isn't professional and shouldn't be shared over work email. A lot of other shit happened too. Now I'm broken and tired and just want to run away to the wilderness but it doesn't exist anymore, especially not in the polluted and soon-to-be-underwater concrete hellscape that is Florida. I'm lost and confused and finding hope in your music even though I hate what trying to follow in your footsteps has done to my life. I just wanna run away from the bad. I just wanna run towards the good. I just wanna run. And yet all I can seem to do is cry for the mistakes we as a living planet have ma de and t he things we have done to ourself. I love this universe. I hate this universe. It's fascinating and brilliant. It's horrible and cruel. It has so much potential and so much risk. I just want to help it. And yet I feel so incapable of doing so. Can we please just start to be a real planet with real goals and dreams and impressive accomplishments instead of a ball of fighting jerks that will destroy itself? I don't know what to do anymore."

        "a": "yes",
        "q": "Can you give me any tips on how to hear and distinguish a fully diminished chord from a half diminished chord?"
      },
      {
        "a": "one thing to remember with 'diminished' chords is, the way they work is upside down. once you get that it starts to make more sense. so when you say the '7th', it actually doesn't really feel or sound like a 7th of anything. let me give you some examples... key of C. first chord C. second chord, just move the bass note up 1, and keep the other notes, so it's C#, E, G. that's C#dim. so it's like C but with the C note moved up. and the chord actually behaves almost just like A7. so a lot of songs may start C, C#dim, when actually it is a very close sister of C, A7. you'll notice this in a lot of songs, especially from the 1930s or 40s. On the subject of the \"diminished 7\" well that sounds pretty much the same. it's just a continuation of the diminished thing, it's all stacked 3rds, a very dizzy sound. and again to use the previous example, it would be like C7, then if you move the C note up and keep the rest the same that is just like C#dim7. and again, it's like a substitute for A7b9. wants to go to Dmin in both cases, and most often will. C, C#dim, Dmin. .... but the other one you asked about, half-dim, (or some people call it min7b5) again the 7th won't really feel like a 7th of anything, because diminished chords don't really sit on their feet, they hang from above, as i'm trying to explain, so actually generally what i would say is, a half-dim chord is gonna sound like a minor triad with a certain note in the bass. let's say, Fmin with D in the bass. that's what it sounds like. let's go to the key of Cmin, and let's say you have Fmin, G7, Cmin. if you take that chord sequence, and listen closely, and plug the headphones into your smartphone, you will notice secretly there might be a D bass note under that Fmin. that makes it Dmin7b5 (or D half-dim) instead. the names of these chords are kind of misleading and don't particularly feel like good names for them but that's just the names that are used. probably less so nowadays because this kind of literacy has fallen somewhat out of style .... but the example i just mentioned is generally the most common way you will hear those chords used. the main thing to remember here is that diminished chords mostly mostly mostly usually nearly always do NOT stand on their own and are not used on their own. so if you start to think too much about the chord individually it will not seem to make sense. yet it occurs very normally and commonly as part of a sequence. so the best thing you can do is just look at where it occurs in songs, and just become accustomed to those patterns. and then you will recognize the pattern. and when you hear that Dhalf-dim, G7, Cmin, you will instantly know it is either that OR Fmin, G7, Cmin. but you will have to plug in the headphones and listen close to see if that D bass note is there, to know for sure which it is. but you were asking about the difference between Ddim and Dhalf-dim, well i would say that those 2 aren't the ones you wanna tell the difference between, they're not really even that closely related. i'd say it's more about telling the difference between Dhalf-dim and Fmin. and the difference between Ddim and Bb7. and in both cases you would need to turn up the bass to hear the difference but there is not that much difference. the way you would tell the difference between Ddim and Dhalf-dim is just that they are used in different parts of the song. it's kind of like a wrench and a broom. you can usually tell which one is which because they are mostly not even used in the same context. but the biggest thing i can say, again, is just look at the songs and just find out what happens in songs",
        "q": "Do you instantly know what it is or do you have to actively concentrate to the 7th?"
      },
      {
        "a": "they have a similar dizzying effect because you are stacking 2 minor 3rds or 2 major thirds in a row, pushing it out of key",
        "q": "Also, why is it so difficult for me to distinguish a diminished triad from an augmented triad?"
      },
      {
        "a": "i hope you are doing this from inside a song and not outside. because dim and aug chords in particular are very much out of context if they are used outside of a song. and with aug, it's almost like borderline it's almost unfair that that one even has a name. because when you get into that territory it's like you're doing a song and you just need to change one note a certain way and you do it. and there might not really be a name for the chord. usually you don't just go around playing augmented chords .... the fact that it has a name make it seem like more of a solid/usable thing than it really is. in other words, the places it is used almost always seems like a sort of exception of some kind. there are many other patterns of notes that are sort of built out of all wholetones, etc, which are a complete mess to try to name. and i feel that a straight up augmented triad is in that family and is kind of unfair that that one gets such an easy name. and i've seen a lot of people get distracted early on trying to learn what it means and what its importance is, just because it gets brought up early in classes along with minor and major chords. but really it's something that should be discovered through songs, as needed. along with all the other things which may not have names",
        "q": "It really shouldn't be, they're way too different and yet I have a hard time doing it. <br/>I can tell the difference between these chords if I try really hard to isolate pitches but I want to be able to instantly hear and know what it is, just like I can instantly distinguish a major from a minor chord. Do you have any advice? Many thanks"

Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, 'Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous?' Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of the universe. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory that is within us. It's not just in some of us; it's in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.\"  ~Mariann e Williamson"
