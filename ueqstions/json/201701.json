Why have you glossed over the atrocities Japan has committed, which are major events in Japan's history? Examples include the Rape of Nanking, the South Korean Comfort Women, and the human testing conducted on Chinese civilians. These are important issues that cannot be forgotten. However, they are not present at all in your video, which has been viewed over 16 million times. This is encouraging the ignorance of the \"darker side\" of Japan's history. While countries such as Germany have deeply apologized for their war atrocities and engrain these events in teaching history to their students, the Japanese government has refused to apologize and Japanese textbooks are being revised to omit these events. I sincerely believe that you are a very learned and good person, thus I hope that you are aware of this and that with your large following and outreach, I hop e that y ou may also raise awareness of this issue. Japan's war atrocities are not to be glossed over. Happy Chinese New Year.</a>"

        "a": "i wonder how people find a reasonable workflow when exporting files out of blender. from what i understand, when you export a file, it drops into a certain folder with no prompt for name or location, and automatically overwrites the previous export. so if you are exporting a lot of files, you have to manually open up a window, and change the name to something else, and also there is NO prompt to warn you if you are about to overwrite. so even if you have the guts to go in and open up the window to choose a new freakin name every time, YOU are responsible for keeping track of what names you have used, or else you risk overwriting a file. the way i see it, there are 2 reasonable ways this could work: number append, or prompt and warn. prompt and warn would be like you have to name the file before save it and if you choose a name that has already been chosen it says WAIT hold on you already named something that. number append would be fine also, that's what cameras do -- it means it never asks you to name your pictures, it just automatically names them with a number after it, 1 number higher each time, so you are never bothered to name your pictures, and never risk overwriting. Now imagine this horrific situation: imagine if your camera names your first picture \"picture.\" and then you take a second picture and it names that picture \"picture\" also, and deletes the first picture. UNLESS you open up a window before you take each picture and come up with a name before you take each picture, and oh by the way it is not going to warn you if you are choosing a name you have chosen before. so you are responsible for keeping track of what names you have used, or else you risk wiping out previous pictures. From what i can tell, this is the behavior blender uses when exporting files. now i'm sure blender is fine, and many people use it, and i'm sure there is a reasonable way to work on projects and export files on a regular basis and not risk having them be constantly wiped out if you don't manually name them something different each time AND keep a manual running record of all the names you used ..... but i don't know how it would be done. i abandoned that program long ago because of this issue, but it still remains a deep existential conundrum as to how blender users actually would deal with this. that is what i wonder",

Another name for this is Cmin7b5 which is a more complicated sounding name, but more clearly states what is actually in the chord. i think realbook usually calls it Cmin7b5. this is the one you will usually see as part of a 2-5 in a minor key. so in the key of Cmin you would commonly see Dmin7b5, G7(b9), Cmin. or something like that.<br/>     ok that's the general rules, now, rule #2 is, never play the root note in the chord, swap it out and let the bass play it. and also make sure you always change the octave of all the notes so it's comfortable. so for example, play C maj7 like this:  C in the bass, then G below middle C, then B below middle C, then E above middle C.  and Fmaj7 would be F in the bass, then A below middle C, middle C, then E above middle C. get used to flipping all the chords around so they are comfortable in the middle range, and leave out the bass.<br/>     step 3 is to vamp through the chord changes in like a simple sort of bossa nova groove, (because it's simple and probably works for anything) no melody, just vamp the chord changes in this way. take your time, and follow the rules.<br/>     now play every song in the book that way and GET READY TO REALIZE STUFF<br/>",

Unfortunately, these annotations are Only available on youtube, meaning the downloadable version on your website is \"More False,\" and therefore to some, \"Not As Good.\" But, I enjoy having a version on my computer! You may have considered some options to prevent a situation where you have to add annotations, but have you considered-Releasing a version that you're satisfied with to the people who read this \"estqunois\" page, so that they can catch the things you might not have, and then incorporating those edits into a \"Final Version\" that you upload to youtube? I know you're not sure about collaborations, but but adding the annotations was a \"Collaboration\" of sorts; And, you seem to be accustomed to the input of the \"people\" on this page already. There are a bunch of problems with this, but it would be an interesting experiment- maybe a shorter Longvideo would work better...? Good luck with the rest of the video."
