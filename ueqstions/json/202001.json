This still leaves room for tremendous amounts of detail. All the details really. the writing process is getting everything EXCEPT the details. That's because when you are constructing the house, (or making the recording, or creating the video graphics), there are SO MANY things to take care of and worry about, just in terms of what materials you use, what details to put, besically that's when the paint actually hits.

      {
        "a": "i'll tell you the way i went through it. my plan, when i was at the exact same stage as you, is to go through them in order. talk/discuss (record the discussion also) the item at hand and determine where it's at. discuss its origins, discuss your first reactions, impressions, think about its origins, .... contemplate its place in the universe , ... and imagine whether you think it's worth it for it to exist / be finished. if you genuinely determine it's worth it, then start pursuing the next steps. determine what piece of it you have. is it the middle? beginning? something else? if it's the beginning, then your next task is to come up with the next part. this is best done by sheer runthroughs, and cut off right at the end, and listen very closely if the next bit will present itself. it can also be good to think process of elimination. what do you know it will and won't be? (categorically). i.e. will be a zebra/pony ride, or will it not be a zebra/pony ride. etc.... that could narrow it down. and again, continue raw runthroughs and cut off at end. If the initial idea was in the middle, that's probably just a lot of process of elimination. Once you have a significant development done on that item, document/date your progress and move to the next one. Then, aftar about 6 months of doing this (writing a little bit on each item) ... then, organize all the items into a new order, by % completed. appraise them all by % complete you think they are (estimation) and re-sort the list.  Then, look at the top group (90 to 99% completed). choose (genuinely, without random assistance) 1 item from that group. Your next task is to finish the writing on that item. when i say 'finish the writing' i mean know how it goes from beginning to end. know all the bars, how many bars, all melody/lyric, chords, ... whatever constitutes your idea of a song in your mind, finish it so you know all that. mark it done. then go to the next group (80 to 89%). do the same thing. pick one, finish it. keep going like this, to the 70s, 60s, etc, all the way down, finishing (writing) 1 item per group. go around the group 2 or 3 times. Now, it's time to record. take the entire list, it doesn't matter what order, but preferably chronological. go through the list, (this will take a day or two) for each song, check how the song goes (properly consult all your documentation for it, read it, play it, check out all samples, etc. fully check how it goes, even if you think you vaguely remember. look it up for real.) then decide 'would i be excited to record this' or 'would i not be excited to record this'? your list of 'yes's can be as long as you want, so don't worry about 'to the exclusion of all other' just yet, just ask yourself would you be excited on some planet in some universe to record this one. if yes, then add it to a list (this is the semi-finals for recording selection list). Continue going through the entire master items list and add all the ones you would be excited to do. Then, as soon as you've gone through the entire list, IMMEDIATELY numberize the semi-finals list and make a random selection (using computer, like <a href=\"https://random.org\">random.org</a>. It is important that you do this immediately when completing the semi-finals list. Do not go around a second time. whenever i've gone for a second round of elimination, i often end up actually eliminating all of them. Trust your feelings in the first round. and immediately put it up for randomization (pick 1 out of the semi-finals, entirely computer assisted.) The one it chooses, that's the one. You should have already sufficiently eliminated any that are actually wrong for any reason. so you must trust this choice. And do it! This means, because you're working with a list of mixed completion levels, in many cases you will have to first finish the writing. then get to the recording. in cases of 100%, go still do writing verification. open the files, think and consider it, decide if the 100% appraisal holds up. if it doesn't, know that you are required to make a decision 1 way or another as to how to finish it, if not already. Then record it. that's the only thing you work on until the recording is done. and remember, if you get hung up because you think you 'can't make it good enough', remember to finish it anyway and accept your bonus: which is you'll automatically be better next time. then continue to do recording and continue to do it until you start to feel like it's getting so good it makes you angry that not enough people are hearing it. then start opening up some social media accounts,",

Are there any recommendable checks, measures, bits of discipline to make this whole process workable?"

If roots aren't connected, some fungi can transfer the signal. The closer relative the other plant is, the clearer the communication. These messages are usually about the environment and slowly advancing dangers. Quickly advancing dangers (animals eating plants) use hormones and wind. Since these responses are to dangers, plants \"feel\", but as far as we know, not emotions. <br/><br/>We have the questions page bookmarked on our homescreens, we like to explore your really awesome project of a website together:) we know it isn't a question, but it's 3:20AM and we couldn't help but chime in:)"

Not that it would be reasonable for anyone to be able to do so, but still. I just wonder if this is something you've ever felt, or thought about or whatevs."

Meaning EVERY note can MATTER and hold serious weight leading into wherever it goes. I just suppose this anyway...But for Years i couldn't begin to understand the logic to it. Meanwhile, I plowed through a harmony book. learned about all these cool chords Outside of the major scale that relate to the major scale. and implement them as well as fun time signatures into my work in a way that was organic and good. but i still do the dumb chord thing. and so like a year ago to h opefully  evolve and understand why I needed to change I started transcribing pop songs i enjoyed, completely. even maracas for like one upbeat on a single measure. So I think my ear is getting better because of that. i mean it might be ridiculous. considering i'm sure even the players for \"running on empty\"-jackson browne were looking at Much simpler charts than what they actually played. but i insist on doing it.

I've managed to donate $130 dollars but it feels like nothing. It wouldnt even scratch the surface. It might put fuel in 2 cars with small tanks. It can't buy even a cheap firefighting pump, or hardly any livestock feed, or other necessities like that. It brings me to tears knowing I'm capable of so little because of my lack of money. Sometimes I wish I were rich, purely for the ability to fucking help more and make an actual difference. <br/>Sorry, I just had to vent a bit. I can't express these feelings to people around me because ffs, these selfish issues are nothing compared with w hat the  people affected are dealing with and it's childish of me to think like this.
