'absolute pitch' might be a slightly clearer name for it. absolute pitch is mostly not at all what gives music its power. nearly 100% of the power of music comes from the relative relationships between pitches. and the good news is that those can be mastered at later ages, although it still helps to start young but it's not a deal breaker if you don't. where as with absolute pitch, you really can't get there unless you have it locked in by age 6. but as i said before, absolute pitch is hardly important for excellent musicianship, and might even be misleading or distracting",

When I'm in the process of adding notes to the chord, there are definitely some that are obviously not present in the chord. Other notes however sound \"good\" but I wonder if they are actually there or are just \"compliant\" with the chord and are effectively coloring it in a way that sounds nice. As for not having enough notes in the chord, that is a mystery to me. Maybe that problem isn't as bad though because at a certain point you've gone through all the notes in the scale allotted to that chord in a certain range of the piano and hopefully any significantly lower/higher duplicates of those notes would be obvious to pick out."

'i'm stuck in a rut' was essentially all i could fathom at that time. although meanwhile i was going absolutely bonkers via text editors. which i recommend to anyone who is trying to figure out which way is which. my strategy in general was to see if i could deconstruct the entire universe and how it works. that was just the only way i could get my head around the full game of songwriting, including any and all musical/linguistical things i thought i could and might be capable of. somewhere around 2009 i think i found myself ready to get into the full songwriting game, but it still took a few more years after that to get the recording schemes, and the writing schemes, further organized. videos, is yet an entirely separate piece of the puzzle which i had to sort of put together from scratch .... which i am actually doing again now, as it turns out",

As it turns out, lyrics are fuckin' DIFFICULT. The music I usually write isn't very self-expressive; I'm more interested in seeing what I can bring to life in the mind of the listener by using different sounds, tones, and techniques. Writing lyrics feels more akin to public speaking. A very personal, intimate form of public speaking."
