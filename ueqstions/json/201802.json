But I always hit a wall when trying to fit lyrics to a pre-set melody (like for the 2nd/3rd verse of a song). The lyrics seem more forced and unnatural when I'm trying to fit them in a place instead of making the place around them. I'll have a good verse 1 then the other verses kind of drop off. Any tips?"
