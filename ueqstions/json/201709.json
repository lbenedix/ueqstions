I usually write a chord pattern that I think sounds interesting, then I try to build a melody from the notes in the chords. Sometimes I can do it, sometimes I can't.

        "q": "Notes that are sharp I write the sharp symbol, notes that are flat I write the flat sumbol. I never write the natural symbol, and if a note is played with a sharp or flat multiple times in the same bar, I write the symbol each time (instead of just once). This works fine for me, because usually the only per son who reads my sheet music is me. And this system makes sense to me.... but is this a bad strategy if I were to share my music with other people?Like if I were to write something out for some horn players or a piano player or whatever, would this system throw them off do you think?"

That's how good time works! it can speed up or slow down, but there is always the same amount of 'water', and when people aren't very good at keeping time, there are these wedges in the river where there is empty space.\" I love this analogy but I still don't fully understand the \"water\" part in terms of music.

Using the same math... I found that Mercury and Venus are both closest to A. Earth and Mars are closest to G. Jupiter is closest to Bb. Saturn is closest to A. Uranus is closest to C#. Neptune is closest to D. So our solar system is playing, like a Gm9#11 chord? Why such a sad, weird, dissonant chord do you think? Why does our solar system feel like that?

When I do try and sing, I sound like if  Donald Fagen smoked way too many cigarettes and put a clothespin on his nose. I love music, and I like to think that I am pretty decent on the instruments I play, but so many songs are driven by the vocal parts. Like, I think really the function of instruments in a song is to compliment/accompany the vocals (which should usually be front and center)... Not really singing makes it tough for me to actually come up with vocal parts, so I try to over-compensate with the instruments when I write. But when I do play with a singer, usually there's too much going on with the instrumental arrangements and it sounds too jumbled/cluttered. Any advice for me?"

It's often presumed something's wrong with me because I remain silent, but I feel absolutely fine most of the time and I'll be polite/reply when spoken to.

This is a very relevant issue for me as well, and i have some ideas that might be of use... i started out making everything in After Effects (i dont know what software you use but this should be relevant regardless) which is great and amazing but non efficient especially when you have a identity of textures and tones that is some kind of starting point and a through line through all your different projects but reusing previous stuff from other After Effects projects feels werid and is not ideal. i have recently been learning a coding language called Processing which i am using to create programs to execute visuals before i bring them into After Effects. For a a hopefully relevant example to you, i could make a program where i can type in text, have a rgb slider for base color of text, create duplicates of text on top of one another with differ ent colo rs and choose a display style like a repeating pattern of text or a silly wobble distortion or something. Then i can save the text as a picture or video and then do the polishing in After Effects. These little programs you can make for various reasons and reused without loosing freshness or constraints as you can easily add a few parameters to the code for every projects adding on to the base you have built up which you can execute and use immediately. The beginning of this process is the worst by far and takes time but it seems to me like the efficiency ratio is a constant upward line with no plateauing and from your knowledge of html from making this website, i think the starting momentum would not be too terribly slow. this might be helpful to you, thank you for changing the world all the time"

        "a": "all things considered, i really haven't done that many full length songs with videos. actually, all things considered, i really haven't even done that many full length songs in audio either. i have done several, but still not that many. in many ways i am still refining my techniques. there are other things that distracted me as well. the first week after movie star was released, i did several reality clips, because i was intending to release them daily, so i had to catch up on about 9 clips. that took about a week. then i had a lot of trouble really figuring out what direction to go next. i have a strong desire to do only songs (with videos) forever. but free videos (non-song videos) are important too. i ultimately decided to stick with songs. then came the next challenge, which is a demon i've been battling forever regarding song selection. how the hell do i choose what song to do? and do i use randomization or not? this issue has been destroying me for many years, and i can never get my head around it. it seems like every song is good because there is something bad about it. it's like movies -- every story is good because there is something bad about it -- it gives the characters something to overcome. there's so many different types of songs that are each a different way for a different reason, and the only thing that makes sense is to do them ALL. i've gotten very experimental with songwriting, and written a lot of weird shit. i've also had the desire to write much much more 'normal' sounding stuff. i have a lot of both. Any individual choice for what the \"next song\" is always feels totally wrong. like, oh no i can't do that one, it's too weird. or, oh no that one's too normal. or, oh no, that one's too this, or too that. The bottom line is, every song is a certain way, and it's like people, every person has a unique way that they are, and every single person is unlikeable in some way, but that's what makes them likeable. picking just one song has always been completely impossible, and every time i have to just give up and use brute force randomization. which means i just put all the choices in a huge list (usually hundreds long) and use the computer to pick a random number and do that one. this can be good, but also scary, and it really picks songs that sometimes maybe i shouldn't have done. \"crazy/raining\" was picked this way, and i just don't think i would have picked such a lonely/mopey ballad if i had had my own choice. \"free to\" was picked this way, and i guess it was an ok choice. \"california\" was picked this way, and it is a fun song, but for fucks' sake if i was choosing it manually, why would i pick another weed song? i've already referenced 'getting high' enough. people are gonna think i'm obsessed with weed now. \"cuz i love you\", again, another choice that i never would have made manually, and i was scared to do it after it was picked, but luckily i was able to completely re-write the verses to make it work. \"movie star\" and \"got to know what's going on\" were also random choices, but i felt more comfortable with those, especially because they were only 10% written, so i got to finish the writing in whatever way i was comfortable with in the current time. but there are just so many songs in that list that are just so not the right ones to do yet. i really really want to do them all, but it is always impossible to choose one. But it seems that if i actually can make the \"right choice\" then it seems i will increase my chances of getting a good final product that i think is really strong and great, and right for the time. so this time i took another shot at it. i started going through the list, and making note of certain ones that i thought should be 'in the running' for selection ... and i started creating like a ranking list, as i was going through, i was keeping track of which one was my first choice, second choice, etc etc. it took me a long time to work through the list, and i didn't even finish the list before i realized, again, as always, that this is never going to work. i realized i was ignoring songs that are barely written, for some reason. and i was excluding ones that i was nervous about, but actually would be great choices if i could just follow through without questioning. so i think after several days on this system, i somehow got the idea for a hybrid system, where i just go through the list, and tab any ones that i definitely do NOT want picked right now, to the side. this was actually very quick. i actually excluded more than i thought, which was a little risky because it was very similar to the previous all-manual system, but i got through very quickly, and out of the list of 400 i got it down to about 41. my plan was to then make a random pick out of those 41. but i was really nervous about it, and i knew if i got a pick that i hated i would hate the whole system again and be lost again. so i actually went through those 41 again, and really took out ones that i just thought weren't right. and i got it down to 27. THEN i finally made the random selection, out of those 27. the song that came up was just fine, and a good pick. but i think it would have not been picked in manual mode, because it was barely written (just like a one word chorus/hook) and i don't think it would have made the rankings as a 'favorite' because i couldn't really have any strong feelings about it yet, because the majority of the 'meat' had not yet been written. but thanks to the random/hybrid system, it never got excluded from the legit candidates list, because i do think it is a perfectly strong hook and there was nothing wrong with it, and it can easily be written into something great. so i believe that was wednesday aug, 23 that the pick was made. The next issue is just the issue of schedule, and time, and productivity. I have been desperately been trying to find ways to increase production speed by, well, i dunno, 1000%? for many years now. it has been an ongoing problem that what i do takes so much longer than i want it to. so i made a bold goal in saying that i need to have these song+videos done in 2 weeks, and release them every other tuesday. during june of this year i was roughly able to stay afloat on a 1-week per song schedule, that was with the audio only. however, doing a video for a full length song, while i haven't done that many, it has always taken somewhere around 4 weeks or more, just for the video. that was true of crazy/raining, free to, movie star, etc. And this particular song is longer than all of those, it's 3:29. so really, 2-weeks for both audio and video is outlandish. But i keep holding on to the idea that there are always more undiscovered ways of doing graphics that are drastically faster, and still interesting. it's a goal i've been chasing for many years, and i can never seem to reach it, but i still keep believing it's possible. because i've just got so much material left to do, it just needs to happen drastically faster than it is. one key thing i keep coming back to is how i started making videos in the first place. originally i had no idea how to do it, and i thought video making in general was way over my head, but i knew that there always has to be a way to express myself even just using the most simple tools and techniques. and if you look at the first few videos i was doing, throughout 2013 and early 2014, it is clear that i barely knew anything except how to put words on the screen at the right time. but the point is, i knew that you can always express yourself just fine no matter how limited your tools are. so that is my main beacon of light nowadays in terms of trying to drastically reduce production time -- i always keep coming back to this idea that it must be possible to still have a good fun time in videos, with 90% less work than i've been doing. it's a goal that i just can't and won't let go of. So anyway, the pipedream for this project was 2 weeks for the whole damn thing, writing, audio, video. that would put the release date to tues, sep 5. so i got straight to writing, the writing was done in about 3 days, and i think it came out great. very glad, and very happy with the choice. so i put down extremely temp audio, with the right timing and tempo, and jumped into the video. tried to move as fast as i could, although really i was only putting down sort of a very basic layer of what happens, and knew that i really needed to go back through and spice everything up (i did this with movie star). approaching friday before the tuesday deadline, i was basically only about 50% through the video, on the most absolute basic level, so that means there was still a huge amount of work to do. but i knew i needed to get to the audio, especially because there is a delay on that, if i want it to get to itunes/spotify in time for the release, it actually needs to be done and sent 2 days in advance. so i went to the audio .... but then, more demons. i just felt really stuck in a rut, like i've been using the same sounds forever, and i've been wrestling with these instrument randomization methods which work really really well but there's always flaws in the system. i first started using this type of method in 2015 or so-- the basic idea is you randomly select a sound from all your sounds, just pick it entirely randomly, and then you get to decide where in the song it fits. so even if you pick something totally stupid that you think you can never use, if you search through the song, verse, chorus, all the parts of the song, you can always find a certain place that it works. and the result is, when you are listening to the song, you hear these things that are really fresh, and they all sound like the right sound for that point in time. but you never had to go through any effort searching for a sound that would fit. instead, you randomly picked the sound, and searched for where it fit. this was a huge breakthrough i had in early 2015, and i've used this random system for any long song i've done ever since. it works great and produces really interesting results very quickly and effortlessly, and it seems like it eliminates the need to worry or even think. you just keep doing instrument picks, and dropping them into where you think they go, and just keep going, instrument after instrument, until eventually the song is full. But unfortunately, this system starts to fail, sort of like an exponential curve, as the song gets about 75% full, you start running out of places to put things, and yet some of the main important pieces will remain still un-picked. like real basic stuff, like the HH for the verse. or the bass for the chorus. so the question is always, when is it time to abandon the random system and just use normal judgement, pick an ordinary bass sound, and just play the part. But for some reason i have real serious problems just using 'ordinary judgement.' especially on long songs. i just can't seem to do it, i'm so burned out on decision making, and i'm also so scared to make 'ordinary choices', and i'm just so aware that i need to keep things very fresh. and yet, another part of me wants to think only from a writers perspective, and life seems so much simpler when i'm just writing and not thinking about instruments. makes me wish i was just a solo acoustic guitar player/singer where all i have to do is just play the song and not worry about what it's made of, texturally. seems like writing the song is the main game i'm interested in here, and it is so draining to have to worry about the textures on top of that. seems counter-productive, almost like each skill is working to make up for flaws in the other, and when you have to care about both it kind of ruins the game. but, once i get into a good system, it can be really good and fun and can get great results, but what i'm saying is, over the last few years i've been kind of walking on eggshells trying to figure out how to balance the random and non. i keep desperately trying to find solid procedures, to avoid this lost feeling of having no idea what to do next. And i also figured it is really time for me to go out and find some new sounds, which is something i always say i'm gonna do but never do. so i cruised some sites and got a bunch of stuff, and also spent some money, and so basically i spent a whole day cruising for new sounds. this was saturday, sep 2. pretty clear that sep 5 is impossible at this point, but i was making progress on getting some new sounds, and i figured it would be useful. So the next question is, what the heck kind of randomization system am i using, how do i balance it with more 'reasonable' and simple choices, and how do i keep my head straight, and have a real solid procedure for this. i seemed really stuck again, but i very quickly had another huge breakthrough. i decided to pick 50 sounds, manually, and just keep it to those 50 only. this is way less than i usually would need if i was doing random picks, but when i'm doing random picks, as soon as it gets above 100, the computer starts flaking out and can't deal with it. and it's not efficient, because i would be picking like a percussion sound, which might be a whole percussion kit, and i would be only using a tiny shaker or tamborine in like 1 spot, and then picking another instrument entirely. so it's very wasteful, RAM wise, if you think about it. so i just decided i would pick 50 only, and for some reason i decided to pick manually. because i think i tried the same approach once before randomly, and i was stuck without any bass sounds, or something weird like that. so i picked them manually and made sure to spread it out so i had enough of each type. enough drum kits, enough basses, enough 'keyboard' type sounds, enough stringed type sounds, enough lead sounds, enough weird ?? sounds, etc, tried to keep it balanced. and chose mainly from the list of stuff i've made myself over the years, stuff which i've saved that i really like. including a lot of crazy sounds i made while working on history of the entire world. and i got all the choices in order from 1 to 50 so i could easily make random picks. and i just started doing it, picking a random number, and finding where the heck it goes. I also had the song broken up into sections, so each pick was actually an instrument and a section. so this helped ensure that i wasn't neglecting certain sections. i randomized long lists in advance, so i just checked the list to see what the numbers were. so 41, 10 means i have to take instrument 41, and go to section 10, and find a place for it. and pow, very very quickly the song got up to critical mass, and a lot of really special things were going into the song. Within just a couple days, it was about 75% full, with still many crucial things missing (kick or some sections, HH/perc missing for some parts, bass missing for some parts, chords missing for certain parts, etc etc) but generally it seemed the majority of the song was filled in. this was probably about mid-week, just after tues sep 5, so the initial (impossible) deadline had already failed, but i was still aiming for the following tuesday. again, a challenge presented itself as to how to know when to get off the random system, and when to just start finishing and making my own decisions and just filling in the essentials that are still missing. but i've just been so drained and in-a-rut about these issues that i was really careful about this and wanted to know what the solid procedure is. ultimately, what i've learned from this, is i've decided that it should be about 100 random picks per minute of song, because it was at about 350 picks that i really became sure that the random picking had saturated the song as much as it could, and some of the 'weirder' sounds had already come up so many times that any more would make them not sound unique anymore. so i think in the future, the idea is to let it get to 100 picks per minute of song (i.e. for a 3 minute song, the limit should be 300 picks) and then just jump to car-testing, troubleshooting. it's always good to ditch into troubleshooting early, even if you know it's terribly incomplete. i went to car testing extremely early on the 'movie star' song, just for the hell of it, because that one was actually on a week deadline, and while there were huge things missing, you just put the biggest issues into a list, then fix the list, then do it again. and believe it or not, i think it's never been more than 4 lists to completion, even when i ditch into car testing a bit early. so anyway, i went to troubleshooting, really planning to get it set by sunday morning, to have it sent out by then, and type in a deadline of tues (which means it's out of my hands and the stores would publish it on tues) and just create an outrageous externally imposed deadline to finish the video, which by the way still required a huge amount of work. but i just still wasn't done troubleshooting until later sunday/monday, and i just keep being more meticulous with this thing. because i just want it to be really good! so the mix was declared done on monday or so, but i still didn't want to send it until i was a little more sure that i could definitely finish the video within 2 days. Then, something else happened, i heard back from youtube about the content ID system, which is something that i've sought after for a long, long, time, which is the ability to monetize re-uploads of my videos on other peoples' channels. this is a very exclusive tool set that big youtube creators and companies have access too, which allows them to claim other peoples' videos when they infringe their copyrights, and either have them taken down, or, more often, just leave them up and have them monetized on that user's channel. this could be a big potential source of income, and for me, since i absolutely never put ads on my own channel, and i've always been slightly uncomfortable with people uploading censored verions, remixes, etc, (but still never wanted to police it or take it down cuz that's just mean) it would be a great way for me to actually earn some income without having to monetize on my own channel, if i just monetize all that stuff whenever other people re-upload it. it could mean the ability to actually really do this 100% full time, without having to work for anyone else, ever. and also maybe afford to move to a better studio, start actually playing drums in videos, get a faster computer, etc.. so i've been patiently trying to get access to this feature, but it's very very exclusive, and it's very hard to get it, and youtube has told me in the past that they weren't going to let me have it. but i recently heard back from someone who seems to be guiding me through the proper steps, so there's all these certifications i had to take, so THAT kept me occupied for a day or 2, then i finally got back to working on the video. and at this point, i've blown past multiple tuesdays since the original tuesday i had fantasized (however impossibly) about having it done, and i just ... again, i'm still desperate to have a breakthrough that makes this stuff 10 times faster and easier, and i am holding on to the hope that i can do that. and in the future i still think i can get it down to 2 weeks, for song+video. additionally, just in the last week or so i have started to think maybe i should still alternate between songs and non-songs. with either one hopefully being done in 2 weeks. anyway, so that is what's going on, and to be honest right now the video process is going very slowly. looking to have a similar breakthrough that i had the other week with the music, something that allows me to just blast through on simple-mode, and would allow me to easily keep things interesting, over the course of a 3 and a half minute song. i mean, what i do is not exactly run-of-the-mill. the reason i've acheived such great results is because i kind of have a standard of making things as good as i possibly can. if i had just not cared, i don't think i would be where i am today, and gotten the results i've gotten. not to mention, making full videos for 3-minute-plus songs is something that i have still only done a relatively low number of times, and in addition, i always need to make sure that i am pushing things to new heights and challenging peoples' expectations, which again is one of the staple elements that has brought me to where i am today. so yes i am desperately looking for ways to make things 10 times faster, but also while preserving the ability to make each moment, and the whole product, mind-meltingly special, if i possibly can",

Working completely alone is a different thing. it means you can't use actors, you can't have camera operators, .... you are limited to entirely different mediums, like animation, etc. and that is very hard work. like i said, it depends on your level of difficulty in working with others. if you really really can't do it (like i can't) then it might be worth it to re-imagine your entire career around things you can do yourself. at least until you have more resources. nowadays you can get further than ever working alone",

But right now, I'm stuck in a MAJOR rut. Like, what do I do with all this music? The logical thing I think would be pairing music with videos, graphics, or some kind of visual aspect. But the thing is, I've never really felt the \"calling\" of being a video-maker. It's not really something I'm passionate about at all, in the same way I am about making music... and if im not passionate about it, why even do it? Even if I do decide to at least try making videos, I have no experience in it and wouldn't even know where to begin... Also, I feel like just making videos for the sake of pairing something up with my music isn't a good strategy since it would just be like forcing 2 things together instead of creating something with sound and visuals together that go hand and hand as pa rt of a whole. I have some songs that I think can stand alone, like more traditional verse/chorus stuff with vocals... but most of my stuff is like weird little instrumental pieces, like 10 seconds to a minute in length, which I don't think would make much sense on their own (when I wrote them I had certain images in mind, like this song reminds me of a mad scientists tinkering with a bunch of test-tubes and bubbling chemicals, this song sounds like you just got \"game over\" in a video game, this song sounds like you just had an idea and a light bulb went off over your head, this song sounds like your taking a walk and then something crazy jumps out in front of you, this one sounds like you tried to do something epic but then failed in an anticlimactic way at the very end, etc)... sorry for this long rambling text. But I just feel like I've been standing in front of the same hurdle for a very long time and have no ideas how to jump over it and it's disheartening. If you have any advi ce for m e, I'd really appreciate it. Like should I just force myself to try to learn how to make videos, and hope that over time I learn to enjoy it, get better at it, and find my own voice/style? Or should I seek alternate routes (which routes, I don't know) that don't involve me making videos?"

THEN i jumped in at the deep end by accepting a task, which is this play. in fact i was going to refuse but i had to accept, 'they' made m e. the m ain theme they gave to me was very common, but safe and i was given enough time to write. for like a week i didn't even start, i didn't think about it and then i remembered and i said \"okay, you know what, fuck this. they want me to do what everyone else does. i'll give them and the audience the theme they want, but i'll do it my way.\" and i started to write nonstop, contextualizing the subject in a way no one ever dared before. i didn't care, i was just writing and soon i realized it's finished in just eight hours. because of this success i was feeling confident, i sent them the script saying \"listen to me, i am your only chance to put this play on the stage in time, here is my script, i know it's crazy but i also know it's good, accept it or accept it, i won't be directing anything other than this.\" politely. and they LOVED it, i must admit that i was surprised. the play will be staged three months later (which is also a short time like eight hours for a play but i'll handle it) and i might do voice acting. i'm sure they will cut out the best scenes 'because it's not appropriate' but doesn't matter. the important thing is i have the original script i have written and one day i will be able to revive it the way i want. after the play is performed i'll continue with small but fast steps because i still don't feel ready to run, just like i said before it's just the beginning. so here comes the questi on, is m y situation somehow similar to how you started doing your contents?"

Then you didn't want to get pigeon-holed as \"The Guy Who Makes Short Videos\" and when your fans came to expect more and more short videos, you put out HOJ and HOTEWIG. Then when everybody started demanding more and more history videos, you didn't want to get labeled as \"The Guy Who Makes History Videos\". Now, it seems like your focus is music videos for medium-length songs? My question is, what happens when everyone starts demanding more music videos and you become associated with this particular form of content? Will we see another big shift? Again, sorry if I'm oversimplifying your 'creative trajectory'. Like I said, I know you do all types of stuff. I'm a big fan of everything you put out, and you've been a huge inspirat ion to me as a musician myself, and as just a fellow person tryna be a person.  Thank you for everything you do."

BUT t he misconceptions about aspergers remain. even with new people in my life, some of these people still think autistic = retarded / incapable of anything except math. i feel bad because by shutting up about my diagnosis i am not helping other who still get discriminated. should i 'come out' again as having aspergers? so that people will know people with aspgergers actually all have a different personality that is build up of many layers just like everybody else?"
