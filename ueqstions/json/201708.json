So really all this is saying is, play it like 32nd notes (or 16ths, depending on whether the triplet bracket takes up a whole bar or half a bar, that you can discern by looking at what else is in the bar)... so yeah basically the only technical difference between this and 32nd notes is basically they are just asking you to play the first 10 notes slower by an extremely negligible and unnoticeable amount. unless of course the rest of the music is in triplets anyway, in which case it would be normal to divide it in 3's. a lot of questions here that the context will answer. such as the tempo, and what the notes are",

        "a": "i'm hearing different ones than you are mentioning, like the one that comes out most prominently is the top of bar 2 (in 6/8) there is a loud F note (out of key). this is a hammer-on, from the wrong half of the string. this only happens acoustically, and it happens worse when you are playing in the middle of the string (or in the high fret range). if you do a hammer-on, it vibrates the correct half of the string (which gives you the note you want) but also the back half of the string (to the left of your left hand). on electric, you usually wouldn't hear it. but unplugged, the 2 notes will be of equal volume if the note is near the middle of the string. so in this case it is exactly in the middle of the string (12th fret) so both sides resonate equally. on a fretless instrument i think this would be the same note, but because it's fretted instrument, the target point to press is actually on the right bar of the fret, not the left. but the reverse note is happening from the other side, from the bar on the left side of the fret. so it's a slightly shorter distance. so you'll get F instead of E. this is not the note that you mentioned, but it seems to be the loudest and most obvious one right from the very beginning. the reason it is particularly problematic is because he's hitting it harder, for groove's sake, since it's the downbeat of the bar. really to avoid this in an acoustic close-mic situation is you have to try not to hammer as hard with the left hand, and do more of the work with your right hand. the rest of the quiet out-of-tune notes i believe are also unwanted reverse hammer-ons, but as we get closer to the left (the head? neck? sorry don't really know guitar terms, i am not a guitar player) the reverse hammer-on would be quieter, and higher. wherever you do a hammer-on, the lower (longer) of the 2 notes will be louder. that's just my analysis. i'm not really a guitar player",
        "q": "Hi, I was the one who asked about Ryland by Julian Lage (on World's Fair). There are really quiet notes in the first and second measures of the song (if you are thinking of it in 6/8) starting on the sixth 8th note that goes A D A D A. And the next time it happens is on the down beat of the 4th measure and the notes are G E G E. There are other times it happens with different notes too. My first guess was that they were harmonics because some of them seem out of tune but I can't figure it out."

(words, concepts, characters, things you can identify like a cat or a dog, etc. that sort of thing) ... if you have that, then the instruments and sounds can work to their full effect, seemingly enhancing the power of those items in front. just some general hints from the way i usually look at things, although there are surely other ways to do it",

And I sit there for one and a half hours, listening to at least one of my classmates screw up almost every question, discovering that some of them don't even know what 2^4 is. I mean, come on, Bill. Am I just wasting my time in school? I know that you at least went to high school (and partially to college, I think, I dunno), but you knew that (1) you learn better when you taught yourself and (2) you had nothing to gain from school. What do I do now? I mean, I've always loved school, but that was because it was easy for me. I never had to do anything because I always taught myself everything I needed to know. Now, though, I'm kind of yearning for a challenge: as you said, I wanna be somet hing, go somewhere, do something. I want things to change. None of this seems to be happening for my in school.

Additionally, any other notes you were using in the chord can usually translate to the other, and usually a light-dark or dark-light transformation occurs. for example if you had G7 with 9, 13, (the 'light' notes) and you flip the bass to Db, and leave all the same notes, they become the 'dark' notes on the Db7 so it becomes Dbaug7#9. This whole line of thinking is generally only applicable in the school of thinking that the notes B and F with G in the bass should resolve to C and E, with C in the bass. or B and F with Db in the bass resolve to F# and A# with F# in the bass. so why not switch",

In the key of c, the French augmented sixth chord would be Ab-C-D-F# leading to the 'clean V' (as I call it), G-B-D-G, or even better, the Gsus4. The most common use of the augmented sixth chord (google it if you're into nerdy music theory) is the German augmented sixth chord; Ab-C-Eb-F# (in the key of c), that then leads to the cadential dominant 6/4 chord (G-C-E-G) that leads to the 'clean V' and finally to the tonic of c. As a professional classical musician, the German aug. sixth chord is by far my favorite chord (in cadences), so I guess my question is; now that you know about it and you're good at writing catchy jingles, would you consider using it in your music?"

B) learn to read using beginner music books and get frustrated because i can only read things like hot cross buns so far. (maybe a tad more advanced than that.) it was fairly equal a month ago but now i spend 95% of the time i play on A and 5% on B. so, i haven't progressed on reading much. that's problem 1.<br/><br/>problem 2 is: i think i have a pretty good ear. BUT i sometimes hit a limit: when it gets to be 5 or 6 or more keys pressed at the same time, it all starts to sound like One Big Thing and i have trouble distinguishing the notes, especially low ones. (keep in mind that i can't NAME the notes/chords from hearing them, i can just copy what i hear after hunting around a bit.) i know some musicians are able to identify notes in big chords really easily and accurately, and it seems almost like they were just born with that ability, which is kind of scary,"

I know so many artists, writers, musicians etc who are so meticulous and who spend more time thinking about what they're gonna do, then they do actually doing the thing. Like when I'm writing a song... I scrutinize every single phrase.. is that the best rhythm? Should I use a different chord to harmonize this note? Should this be louder or softer, should I use this effect, etc. But if I w ere Bob Ross, I would just throw a big old wrench into the song on a whim, and make it work.

Do you have an overarching concept or vision that guides your work? Zappa called this 'conceptual continuity' and it was a huge aspect to his music. I've also noticed this a lot in Prince's music (a lot of songs are self-referential or reference other songs, and there's certain little recurring rhythmic patterns that he uses, and certain ideas, like sexuality and spirituality, get revisited often). Dwayne Thomas Jr., a great bass player, takes it a step further and says that you should write down your own artistic vision and read it daily... So do you have your own, specific vision or 'conceptual continuity'? It doesn't have to be something that is clearly evident to fans, but just something in your own mind that your working towards, or kind of ties everything together for you?"

        "a": "step 1 is, find the beat. so as the music is going, see where you would tap your foot or nod your head, or wave your conducting wand. in most songs, this is pretty easy to find. of course you could always make crazy songs where you can't find it, but in Most songs you can find it. however, in most songs you can also do it twice as slow (or half as fast) if you want. in some songs, it is at just a certain tempo that you're almost not sure whether to tap the beat at one speed or twice as fast. this is ok, any piece of music can be written in multiple ways, you could set the tempo twice as fast and write all the notes as half the values and it would mean the same thing. but in most songs, it is reasonably clear where the foot-tap is. and i will go a step further to say that most music usually has these beats grouped together in groups of 2, 4, 8, etc. the way most music is written on paper is in groups of 4 beats, with bar lines dividing the bars (or 'measures'). most music uses 4 beats per bar. that being said it is really up to you to decide where the begining of the bars should be. but i think in most music there is a clear answer. to learn how to detect other time signatures besides 4/4, just start finding examples of them and then you will get better at hearing them. but when songs use 3-based time signatures, it can often be represented in multiple ways, many of which actually still heavily involve 4s. 2s, 3s, and 4s, are used all the time in music. it is very rare that music consistently uses a 5 or 7 pattern all the way through. usually when time signatures like 5 or 7 happen, it tends to be only once, and then goes back to 4. it is quite common for songs to need to add an extra beat or half a beat here and there, particularly at the end of the chorus or at the end of a section. this is accomplished by having 1 bar that is a different time signature. it is much more rare to have a song that entirely is based on a 5 pattern or a 7 pattern or another higher odd number. i'm not sure if that answers your question actually, but i think my most important point is that most music is in groups of 2, 4, and 8. and the way that is most commonly written on paper is with 4 beats per bar, and the time signature is called \"4/4\" (actually the first number is written above the second number but that's not easy to type here) the top or first number represents how many beats per bar. the bottom (or second) number is supposed to tell you what kind of a note gets the beat. so 4/4 should technically mean there are 4 beats in a bar and a 'quarter' note gets 1 beat. i realize there are holes in this system and many time signatures really can't be analyzed quite this way but that is the way the idea is supposed to work",

I guess, in general, im curious if you approach voicing harmony differently for different instruments? Would you write a vocal harmony differently then a horn arrangement, etc?

One thing I'm trying to do to get a better \"ear\" for music is to pick out little patterns and phrases and stuff that catches my attention. There's this one thing that I hear all the time... I heard that one Charlie Puth song, One Call Away, on the radio today. Towards the end of the song (starting at around 2:19 in the album version, not the music video) when he does like a stripped down, variation of the chorus he sings the line \"nothing on me\" and he adds this little twist that makes it sound different than the other choruses in the song. Like he adds some kind of extra chord or something. I'm drawing a blank on other specific songs I've heard something almost exactly like this, but I know it's something I hear very often in a lot of music, especially pop and R&amp;B type stuff. I can't seem to figure out exactly what's going on though, or what the little cho rd varia tion thing is. Can you maybe help me out on this?"

Look ahead, like to the whole line, and you should be able to get an idea of what's happening, at least if it's anything reasonably 'normal' going on. it should jump out at you. the more songs you know and the more experience you have, the easier this will be. But some songs might be more unexpected, experimental, and you might not be as sure where they're going. So if things start to feel uncertain, that's where you have to just start to zoom in slightly closer, and only look at 2 bars. worst case scenario, you JUST look at the one chord, and then just use the 'available notes' in a technical way. But usually you should be able to zoom out to AT LEAST 2 chords, or hopefully more. and the farther you zoom out, the better an idea you should get of what's going on. but let's say it's worst case and you really aren't sure where things are going and you are just looking at 1 chord, i still think 'scales' are not quite the right way to look at it. Just be aware of what the good notes usually are, and sort of rank them. The real good notes will vary depending on the context of the song obviously, and if you really know the song this will change everything, but as you said you are looking for tricks to use when you really don't know the context and all you have is a chord symbol staring you in the face. just sort of rank the notes. and there are all kinds of clues that will change things. so let's say the chord you're looking at is Fmaj7. well even still you can look at context. is the song in C, or in F? that will usually change the context. but on Fmaj7 your strongest notes are going to be E, A, and C. next probably G. If the chord is Cmin7, your strong notes are going to be Eb, then G, then Bb. again, context will always change this, but these are sort of the technical best options for when you really don't understand the context, for whatever reason (like if it's just a strange song doing a disorienting thing). for dominant 7th chords, there are a million zillion contexts for those chords, so you're really gonna have to know the song to figure out what's going on there, but your guaranteed available notes for example on G7 would be B and F. beyond that, anything else is kind of risking it, because 7th chords can be in all kinds of crazy contexts. sometimes specifics will be added. so let's say if it says G9 (which means G7 with a 9 on it) then you've got B, F, and A for sure. almost even favor A, because if the writer wrote G9, that must mean the A note is important. so just go for that note. if it's G7b9 then you'll be fine with B, F, and Ab. Zooming out a little bit more to a 3 chord sequence, things get clearer. since you mentioned the real book, I'll mention certain things that would occur there. if you're in Cmaj and you see D-7, G7, Cma7, you should really be looking at that whole figure altogether. basically what that figure means is \"we're coming in for a normal landing on Cmaj.\" so just, i dunno, just get used to stuff you can play over that. don't think about the chords individually, think about coming for a landing on Cmaj at the designated time. your F note is going to be in the running for the entire time BEFORE the landing, and when the landing hits you will want to be on E, G, perhaps B, maybe D. prior to the landing you will want to be using notes like D, F, also G, A, etc.. Looking at the case of a minor key version of the same thing, the familiar pattern (again speaking in terms of the real book) would be something like Dmin7b5, G7b9, Cmin. again, this means \"coming in for a landing on Cmin\"... resolving to C minor is a little bit more interesting, and a bit more crazy things are usually possible. Ab note will feature prominently BEFORE the landing, and you will want to land on G, Eb, perhaps D if it's a Cmin9 specifically, etc. before the resolution, B, D, F, also Eb, Bb should all be fine. When a G7 resolves to Cmin in the key of Cmin, that is an especially strong case of \"not all notes behave equally\" -- this is really always true, and again that's why i don't like to use scales because scales implies that all notes are equal. and that's really not true. it's like characters in a movie. sure all the characters are there, but they all have different personalities, have different roles to play, and are featured with different levels of prominence. Again, in general when improvising, always zoom out as much as possible and try to gather a sense of where the landing points are, identify when it's getting to where it's going. usually you can tell pretty clearly by zooming out, and it gets easier the more experience you have. If you have a clear idea of where the thing is going by the end of the line, or by the beginning of the next line, you can really lean back and go wherever you want to go in the meantime, because you know very clearly when it has to get to where it has to go, and it will feel fine. it's like going down a staircase. you can do as many backflips as you want and you don't even have to touch any of the stairs as long as you land at the bottom of the stairs at the right time",
        "q": "But, honestly, looking for work as a musician, being able to improvise off of a lead sheet is a good skill to have. I know there's a lot of gigs out there where you just kind of flip through the 'Real Book' and take turns comping/soloing over whatever song you happen to turn the page to. If somebody put a piece of sheet music in front of you that you've never hear d or pla yed before, how would you put together a solo that sounds good/interesting to you? Can you sight read the melody, but instead of playing the melody you're reading, come up with a variation of that melody on the spot as you're reading it for the first time? That seems really difficult."

        "a": "step 1 is, find the beat. so as the music is going, see where you would tap your foot or nod your head, or wave your conducting wand. in most songs, this is pretty easy to find. of course you could always make crazy songs where you can't find it, but in Most songs you can find it. however, in most songs you can also do it twice as slow (or half as fast) if you want. in some songs, it is at just a certain tempo that you're almost not sure whether to tap the beat at one speed or twice as fast. this is ok, any piece of music can be written in multiple ways, you could set the tempo twice as fast and write all the notes as half the values and it would mean the same thing. but in most songs, it is reasonably clear where the foot-tap is. and i will go a step further to say that most music usually has these beats grouped together in groups of 2, 4, 8, etc. the way most music is written on paper is in groups of 4 beats, with bar lines dividing the bars (or 'measures'). most music uses 4 beats per bar. that being said it is really up to you to decide where the begining of the bars should be. but i think in most music there is a clear answer. to learn how to detect other time signatures besides 4/4, just start finding examples of them and then you will get better at hearing them. but when songs use 3-based time signatures, it can often be represented in multiple ways, many of which actually still heavily involve 4s. 2s, 3s, and 4s, are used all the time in music. it is very rare that music consistently uses a 5 or 7 pattern all the way through. usually when time signatures like 5 or 7 happen, it tends to be only once, and then goes back to 4. it is quite common for songs to need to add an extra beat or half a beat here and there, particularly at the end of the chorus or at the end of a section. this is accomplished by having 1 bar that is a different time signature. it is much more rare to have a song that entirely is based on a 5 pattern or a 7 pattern or another higher odd number. i'm not sure if that answers your question actually, but i think my most important point is that most music is in groups of 2, 4, and 8. and the way that is most commonly written on paper is with 4 beats per bar, and the time signature is called \"4/4\" (actually the first number is written above the second number but that's not easy to type here) the top or first number represents how many beats per bar. the bottom (or second) number is supposed to tell you what kind of a note gets the beat. so 4/4 should technically mean there are 4 beats in a bar and a 'quarter' note gets 1 beat. i realize there are holes in this system and many time signatures really can't be analyzed quite this way but that is the way the idea is supposed to work",

Try those. hint: happy birthday will actually require you to expand the range down to G, when playing it in the key of C. happy birthday would start on the low G note. the other 2 songs should start on C and only use the notes from C to C. let me know if this helps. all this is called \"playing in the key of C\", where the C note will feel like your home base. for example, if we were to play these songs in the key of D, all the notes would be up a little higher, and as an added twist you have to swap in a couple of black notes to get it to sound right. but you will learn that later",

But what bothers me most is that most young people or even older ones are not into opera at all, I think mostly because cultural marketing isn't done very well and doesn't manage to draw new audiences. How many times have I heard people found it \"annoying\"... I would find it very frustrating if my job were something few people are interested in.

        "a": "attack is how quickly the note starts. so if 'attack' is set all the way short, the note starts immediately when you press the note. if 'attack' is set to a longer setting, the note will gradually fade in when you press the note. Decay is what happens to the note when you keep holding it down. very short decay means the note will drop off to silence immediately, even if you are holding it down. longer decay means it will fade out very very slowly as you hold it down, or maybe even never fade. release is what happens to the note after you let go. short release means the note disappears instantly when you let go. long release means it lingers after you let go, and fades slowly, or even if you set the release to maximum, it will probably stay forever. Sustain is an additional bonus option. instead of \"decay\" decaying to 0 volume, you can set 'sustain' at a certain level and that will be the volume level that it decays to while you are still holding the note down. then when you let go, the 'release' happens from there. so for example, if you set all 4 sliders (attack, decay, sustain, release) to \"medium\", and you press your note and hold it, the note will fade in at a medium pace, then drop down at a medium pace to a medium level. then when you let go it will drop to silence at a medium pace. i hope that makes sense",

I try to explain it to people but they can't seem to do it. They probably don't believe me that it's real.<br/><br/>This happens because some lights flicker with the AC power at 50 or 60 Hz, and some of the segments are out of phase with the others. So if you vibrate your head up and down at about the same frequency, you see some lights appear to be higher or lower than others, depending whether your head is at the top or bottom of its vibration when that light flickers.<br/><br/>I find it works best with LED Christmas lights, but oven displays are pretty good too."

        "a": "i think the challenges you mentioned are very possible to overcome. use a digital voice memo recorder. the one i use can hold 17 hours, and the battery life lasts for probably 10 hours but maybe more. i bought it 8 years ago, so i'm sure they're better now. but i was going to suggest you use 2. with a little practice and planning you could alternate between them. it is likely that you would only need to switch once. the next challenge is editing, but i think you can use multiplication to your advantage. and you will probably use different programs, depending on what does what better... or maybe you can do it in one. i'm pretty sure there are programs that will open a 24 hour file. really you just need to use that program to break it into 24 pieces. make sure volume is at 0 (even, not plus or minus anything), and there is no master compression or anything (garage band for example has some automatic compression i think but that will mess you up for this project). then once you have it down to 1 hour pieces, i would suggest opening them up in a program like logic or protools, and just put them all in on 24 tracks. that should be reasonable. again, no compression, and from here on, make sure that all tracks are set to about -15db, because the noise is going to stack up. export this 1 hour of 24 tracks stacked together. then open a new file and import this, and cut it into let's say 30. 30 tracks of 2 minutes each. make sure you set your time settings to be by time, and grid snap to minutes, OR if it is on a musical bars/measures setting, just set your tempo to 120 bpm (which it likely already is by default) and 2 minutes should be exactly 60 bars. so cut every 2 minutes, that's the beginning of bar 61, 121, 181, 241, and so on. stack them all down vertically, so you have 30 tracks of 2 minute regions. export this. again, NO master compression, and i think from here on you can keep your volume at 0 -- the trick is to make sure that it was low enough on the one where you lowered it. maybe even -20 would have been good, to be safe. so now you should have 1 file that's 2 minutes long that has everything. repeat the process, you are almost done, split this into 8 if you want 15 second final length, split it into 12 if you want 10 second final length, or split it into 24 if you want 5 second final length. at 120 bpm, 5 seconds is 2 and a half bars. 10 seconds is 5 bars, 15 seconds is 7 and a half bars. (that's if you are in a musical program measuring by bar. otherwise just set it to time grid). split it up, stack it up, no compression, keep the volume at zero, and then you should be done. I think this process is actually within reach. the exporting could take a while in the first round. but i think if you try different programs and perhaps toy with the values in this system, i think you can get there. Now, here is the bigger challenge, which i don't really have a solution for -- you're going to have an insane amount of walking noise, pocket noise, or even if you keep the thing out of your pocket the whole time, there is going to be loud unwanted noise any time you touch the device, or if you set it down, basically unless you are holding it the right way in your hand for the entire time. that is probably going to be the bigger challenge. because i think over 24 hours, all that noise will add up and that will be all you hear. you won't be able to hear any of the ambient noise you're looking for, because the direct mic contact noise will be about 5 times louder and i think it will fill the whole time when stacked 144,000 times. now it might be possible to use a noise gate that actually silences anything above a certain db. i'm not sure if these exist, i only know of noise gates that silence anything BELOW a certain level, or just flatten anything above a certain level, which is not what you want because you will still hear all the mic contact noises. but if you can get a noise gate that can silence anything above a certain db, i think that could be just the ticket, with some experimentation. i would recommend putting that on at the 1 hour level, applying it to all 24 1-hour tracks. i hope that helps",
        "q": "Do you ever have a very specific idea of what you want (maybe like a specific graphic, visual effect, sound effect/tone, etc) but you don't know how to actually go about executing your idea? For reference, there's blogs and vlogs but I want to make condensed what I'll call \"slogs\" (sound blogs) where I record all the sounds around me (speaking, car sounds, music, radio, footsteps, cooking sounds, animal sounds, literally any sound that can be picked up by a mic) for 24 hours.. then I went to take that 24 hour recording, splice it into 10 second fragments (or maybe 5 seconds or 15 seconds, haven't decided) and layer all the spliced clips on top of eachother and play it all simultaneously so you have this cacophony of 24 hours worth of sounds smashed into 10 seconds... but I don't think recording softwares can handle that much audio files, and cpu or phone batteries don't last 24 hours.... I really want to do this, but I don't see how it can be done.... and it's wildly frustrating for me."

Isn't it a little disingenious to just say to people to mess around with music when there's so much more to music than that?

Another way of looking at it -- if you are by yourself, play chords with your right hand and play bass (1 note!) with your left. Or, if you are playing the melody and chords, and someone else is the bass player, then i guess play chords in the middle range with your LEFT hand, and do the melody with your right hand. and if your band already has a bass player and someone else playing the melody, then tie one hand behind your back.",
        "q": "Sometimes I'll play different inversions. Like for example to do like a cm9 chord I might play a cm7 (C,Eb,G,Bb) with the left hand and a Ebmaj7 (Eb,G,Bb,D) with my right.... but I don't know."
      },
      {
        "a": "the bass should only be 1 note at a time. the way the notes work is, the lower you go, the less notes you can play. this is a very clearly defined thing, there is something called \"lower interval limits\" and i think if you look it up you will find very clearly when to stop using which intervals as you go lower. actually, don't look it up, just experiment for yourself. 1 note is the lowest -- for example, the lower interval limit is, let's say, the B at the very bottom of a grand piano. that's the lowest you can really go and have the note still sound like a note (i'm sure people will argue that the limit is actually lower, but i don't really care, beyond that low B it really turns to mud). actually screw it let's say C because it's easier for this example. so let's say low C on the 88key piano is the lowest limit for single note (this also happens to be right at the bottom of the range of the 5 string bass guitar) ok so that's the lower limit for 1 note. next thing to look at is a perfect fifth. the lower interval limit for a perfect 5th is exactly 1 octave above that -- which in this case means C and G, in the second octave of a grand piano -- so the second lowest C and the second lowest G. This would be about as low as you can put perfect 5ths and still have them sound coherent (again, people will argue that you can go lower, but for the sake of this example i'm keeping it at C). Next look at 4ths -- this piggybacks on the 5th -- the same G, and the next C. that is the lowest your 4ths are going to work. I should mention, in heavy rock bands with distorted guitars, all those heavy metal riffs are usually written with \"power chords\" which is root-5th-root, hugging the lower limit, and the bass is an octave down, also hugging the lower limit for single note. standard tuning puts both instruments at E, and many bands downtune and B is just about as low as they usually go, before it starts becoming unintelligible. this is another simple way to observe the lower-limit phenomenon in common practice among distorted guitar metal bands, etc. So piggybacking on what we have so far (did i mention we are just climbing up the harmonic series) the next note on top of that C would be E. so for major thirds, that would be the lower limit for 3rds. counting Cs up from the bottom of the grand piano, that would be the 3rd C and the E above it. that should be about as low as major 3rds will work. continuing on, the next note in the harmonic series is G, so the minor third right there (E-G) in that octave should be the lowest that minor thirds will be happy. again, the lower limits are actually perhaps a few notes lower than all the ones i'm mentioning, i'm just putting it a little higher and keeping it in C for the sake of the explanation. that is basically how it works. tigher clusters gradually work better as you go up, bass only works with single notes, a little higher and 5ths work but not 3rds, and then the 3rds become clear a little higher, etc etc. i hope this makes sense. imagine your pen gets thicker as the notes get lower. so you have to write bigger and make the linest further apart. where as up higher, it's like writing with a smaller pen, you can do much more complicated smaller designs and still see it. i just realized i have probably explained this entire thing on this questions page at least a couple of times before",
        "q": "Sometimes that big full sounds good with solo piano, but it can be too much with a full band. As a general guideline, is it better to use less notes in the bass and put the bulk of the h armony h igher up?"

It's kinda tragic, but it's one of the reasons why I really like your site. I think some users are trying to force you into some kind of \"Genre\" of creator (whether it be your site or music or etc) so much that people seem to believe that you're trying to be irreverent, but all you do is just... *is*. Words kinda fail me there, and that's okay I think. People are looking at the pages that update \"top-down\" (as in \"updates as you finish content\" such as the music, videos, and most of the time the questions page) a nd autom atically assume that it applies to Literally Everything In The Entire World Ever All The Time Always when your notebook stuff is clearly labeled with a very definite Date Of Time, emphasizing Creation Chronology, but your site didn't exist forever so you come to this design dilemma for the content that was made Pre-Website: Emphasize Creation Chronology, or Update Chronology? Well, it's not really a dilemma, but it's more that people are too busy trying to see you in their terms as a creator so much that they're missing out on the actually new content.

In Street Fighting Man, Keith Richards got an electric-guitar sound from an acoustic by using a tape cassette to record and overdub the parts and by playing right up to the mic. Link Wray used to poke holes in his speaker cone with pencils to get that fuzzy tone. You had all sorts of experimentation with reel to reel tape recorders to get echos and other weird effects. Lots of old blues guitarists would turn the gain and volume all the way up on lo-fi amps to the point of nearly blowing out the speakers to get their sounds. Sam Phillips (who produced a lot of those 50's rockabilly/rock 'n' roll records with Sun Records) would re-feed the playback from the recorder to the head, adjusti ng the s pace between the heads, tape speed and other stuff to make crazy echo and delay effects.... Today with all sorts of effects pedals, built in effects on amplifiers, digital recording sofwares where you can alter the sounds in so many different ways, do you think that these \"proto-effects\" or these old recording techniques are obsolete?"

For people that are maybe going on this page for the first time and they click on reality or notebook they see the top entries as being from 2016 and (unless they read through this question page) they would think that those pages haven't been updated since then...i think its awesome that you have this question page and your email...that gives you a way to connect/communicate with your fans in a way that many other artists dont. But with that openness comes all the demands and criticisms and trolls (unfortunately). Just remember that when people request stuff they do it because theyre  fans wh o love your work. BTW you're the man, Bill. Love all your content and your music has made a huge impact on me."
