But, here i was, suddenly doing most of my work in a different program which has the distinct advantage of being available on computers made later than 2014. so being aware of that, a spectacular cascade of events suddenly began to unfold, which i can possibly trace back to viewing a youtube rental of spiderman into the spider verse, for which the only way i could watch it was on a borrowed computer, because my main computer had finally become officially too old to play the movie with ANY browser. that realization, combined with seeing how much faster this borrowed computer was from mine (despite actually being the same age), combined with the outrageousness of the visual effects in that particular movie, combined with the previously mentioned reasons for being ready to make the transition, i decided to reach deep into the savings acount and see if i can make things a little more interesting ............",

Or to be more specific, i see a surprising amount of players seemingly not doing anything 'moeler'ish whatsoever in their right hi-hat hand. meaning they're not packaging the strokes in groups of 2, in one single motion together. instead they're just hammering away with their entire arm, for every stroke, going through a lot more effort, looking kind of like they're trying to shake a baby or something. But still, it's on you to sell them on whatever better way you have. kind of like, 'hey, looks pretty tiring the way you're trying to pound out every stroke individually, .... well check this out' and then show them. If you sell it well, they will buy it. But it also comes down to whether it's really right for them or not. If it is, they will know, the first time they see it. and if they don't, then it could be time to start seeing other people. i don't really know, i quit teaching after 2 days",

I'm having severe issues with the VAST amounts of <br/>misinformation being spread mainly by vox populi and youtube/internet articles regarding music education.<br/>It's driving me nuts. One of the worst (and I tend to disagree on a lot of things), I think, it's about <br/>the myth regarding strength and exercise needed to play an instrument, as if playing guitar, <br/>piano or even drums required some sort of strong physical competence to the extent professional <br/>athletes do. I truly believe that playing and instruments in general (save some occasions and styles like<br/>flamenco or extreme metal, perhaps) are learned through very simple principles applied through musical <br/>concepts (or just music), with just standard physical well being (in the majority of cases already <br/>achieved) regardless of gender, ethnicity and to some extent age (and there tons of exceptions to my <br/>favor to th is too!!  But let's play). I'm seeing people getting hurt trying to get better at their <br/>instruments the wrong way and it breaks my heart. I'm a professional musician and educator and I would <br/>really like to have your take on this. I think you are a true great musician and am a big fan of your work, <br/>by the way! Cheers! P.S.: Just in case, nothing against sports, exercise, fitness or whatever."

I have lots of music on my archive that i've collected over the course of 20 years and that i deeply care about (i hate all sorts of streaming sites). And i've put a lot of effort into shaping my music directory and now i am looking at it thinking if i can use more simplified method.<br/><br/>My music directory goes like this:<br/>I have a main music directory named 'Music'. And then, this directory divides into the music genres, and then into subgenres, then into artists, then into albums (if there's any). Then you find mp3/flac files in those directories. If a song of said artist doesn't belong to any album (ie. single song, etc) it goes into directory named 'singles' in the artist's directory. Also, any songs whose artists i have only one song of, they go to the another directory named 'Singles' in the proper genre/subgenre.<br/><br/>For example, if i wanna listen t o Michae l Jackson's Billie Jean, the path i have to go thru is Music -&gt; Pop -&gt; Michael Jackson - &gt; Thriller, because i have the entire album. <br/><br/>Or, 'Zhi-Vago - Celebrate the Love (Club Mix)' is in Music -&gt; Electronic Music -&gt; Trance -&gt; Dream Trance -&gt; Singles, because it's the only song i have of Zhi-Vago.<br/><br/>When you look at it, it really is good method. All songs from all artists in the same genre is in one place. It makes it easier to listen in Winamp. UNLESS artist have many songs from many different music genres. That's the frustrating part.<br/><br/>Do you think this method is good?"

Whats a good way to get over the feeling of having to explain up until the point one is convinced the other has heard to instead be able to get over it and move on. It can even be when giving advice, that maybe the other person doesn't want to hear or is not receiving well, i find that the need to give the advice can be more harmful than the advice itself since it can make the other person feel like they have a bigger problem than they do, or feel like they have emotional homework now having had pointed stuff out. How to know when one wants the advice vs not wanting it. How to stop going in circles when gi ving adv ice and not being cued of the fact that they get it, i dont even know what im trying to ask anymore. Funnily enough whenever I get in my head and find a new problem or solution I feel like you might relate to it and have insight. Looking forward to enjoying whatever it is you're releasing next!"

Even video watching is ok, because most video players are smart enough to buffer it right so the vid syncs right with the audio. But if you're recording music, you're still looking at at least a 200ms latency. can't play an instrument that way. And this is not good for intimate phone calls either, because as it is, in the digital world, all cell phone calls have about half second delay (or more) already. And this gets worse when you're doing international, or internet calling. wireless ear phones will add at least quarter second delay on top of that. however, besides all that, it is truly awesome to have no wires. but i'd say the latency probably isn't down enough to discontinue the headphone jack just yet",

Fm6 wants to resolve to C, G7 and G7b9 want to resolve to C, or to Cm, or if you get sneaky they might go to Am or A, or even F# in some cases. and you look at the common notes here: D, F, Ab, B like to go to chords with their root on C, Eb, F#, A. and a lot of things can be explained by this pattern of minor third series."

What you just gave above is wonderful. this has nothing to do with what i had in mind about major seconds being so useful. Melodies come to mind, when thinking about how 'important' major seconds are. And actually, when you first said 'wow major thirds are like really important', my mind immediately went to melodies (you didn't specify what you really meant, like you didn't specify that you were talking about harmonic resolutions, etc) so yeah, i sort of had to guess what you were talking about, and my mind went to melodies. in which case i think it's easy to see why min 3rds and maj 2nds together are hugely important for that game. maj2nds being an absolutely essential building block of anyone's melody kit",

The click action can be associated with the inclosed text, the bounding box, or both. If the text has no clickable action, it seems reasonable that \"missing value\" would be returned, even if it is able to find the text itself. Automator may have incorrectly assumed the click action was associated with the text instead of the bounding box, or if your program is particularly nasty, the click action may be just associated with a certain x y position on the screen.
