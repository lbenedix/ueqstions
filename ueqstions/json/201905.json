Well college decisions released, and unfortunately, I did not get into the college I wanted and for these past few months I felt very worthless because I kept comparing myself to those who got into my dream school. Most students in my school got in and some I question why and how and I started to fall in this wormhole of depression where I think I was not enough compared to other students because my dream school did not accept me whilst they accepted many others that I thought did not care enough about school. I just feel like the whole world is against me because now I would go to school, ashamed to share the college I'm going to and hearing EVERYONE going to my dream college. Everywhere I go, I hear them getting into my dream college and I am truly happy for them, but it just feels like the whole world is ridiculing me. How can I stop this negativity cluttering up my mind? I know this is so unhealthy for me, but when you are constantly reminded of your failure, how do you cope with that? I really wish you see this because no one around me has the answers and I just feel like I am alone in figuring these things out."

        "q": "It occurs to me that the confusion over the idea of an 'album' is down to a lack of agreement with regards to definition. I think you take the term 'album' quite literally, almost as the term photo album, i.e. a repository for a set of only loosely connected items. Most of the people arguing in favour of a Bill Wurtz album see the album in general as a sophisticated artwork that, in its most successful cases, has not a single note or word out of place and was conceived as a thematic whole, like a novel or a movie, and not as a random selection of songs. All the great albums are apparently random selections of songs, that reveal their inner logic and consistency only gradually, sometimes after many years. Pet Sounds and Rubber Soul fall into this category. You yourself have already made one total masterpiece of an album. Its most satisfying tracklisting (for me) runs as follows:<br/><br/>1) Alphabet Shuffle<br/>2) Outside<br/>3) And The Day Goes O n<br/>4 ) at The Airport Terminal<br/>5) Slow Down<br/>6) Hallelujah<br/>7) Hello Sexy Pants<br/>8) Mount St Helens<br/>9) La De Da De Da De Da De Day Oh<br/>10) Long Long Journey<br/>11) I'm Best Friends With My Own Front Door<br/>12) When I Get Older<br/>13) The Moon Is Made Of Cheese<br/><br/>The new album is also shaping up well ( Might Quit, Just Did A Bad Thing). I'm also not overlooking Christmas Isn't Real: it is my personal favourite of all your songs, but perhaps too high-concept to integrate easily into an album.<br/><br/>You have lifted the single song and video package onto the level of art form almost single-handedly. Pity us older music lovers who are still attached to our 45 minute programs, preferably broken into two halves. The album was our guiding principle, our mainstay, our educator and friend. No movie or novel (or music video) could ever approximate its awesome depth and breadth of vision. Only the truly great managed to master it as an art form, most crashed inexorably on its treacherous cliffs. Indeed, if you set out to create an album as a work of art you may already have shipwrecked. Its easily the most confounding mainstream modern artistic discipline. It's a shame it is really dying. Perhaps it is already dead?"

All the albums that really are worth the candle and aren't just \"compilations of songs\" already do that, at least in my eyes. Take Daft Punk's Discovery for example, or Janet Jackson's The Velvet Rope. Albums that have so many twists and turns that to share only one song off of it at a time is kind of doing it an injustice. THAT'S a sign of a good album - when you need someone to take in the total package rather than just a singular song. It'd be like taking a chord from a song and just playing that rather than the whole song; sure you can do it, but to get the whole scope of things, you need the entire track. An album should be like that, I feel."

Me personally, I view albums as more like a book or a short story, where each track is a particularly memorable sentence from a chapter that sticks in your head, or a plot twist/intriguing moment or something like that. The whole purpose of an album in my opinion is to create a story that's bigger than just one song could provide, or rather tell one story but with a lot of nuance and detail to it. Instead of taking them on a short journey with one song and trying to pack as much as you can in there, with an album you can give yourself time to think and breathe and tell as much as needs telling and in the time it takes, y'know? Not tryna invalidate your approach to \"musical storytelling\", but that's the angle I tackle the music-making bull from, anyway."

And, in the case of, say, the occipital lobe, even if the neurons never receive signals from each other directly, the lobe is still \"aware\" of what the neurons do (aware meaning affecting behavior. In this case, what the neurons do determines how the lobe behaves, i.e. what it communicates to the other parts of the brain, and so we say the lobe is \"aware of\" the neurons' actions. Same applies for part of your brain affecting \"you\").<br/>The ABC scenario is a just simple example of this Russian-nesting-doll of consciousness, where higher levels are aware of the thoughts of lower levels, but not vice-versa. My theory is that, just as a human has independent parts yet feels like a single experiencing mind and not like millions of tiny neuron minds, so too may there be a higher level of consciousness that feels like me and only me, you and only you, Benedict Cumberbatch and only Cumberbatch, â¦ , and perhaps some non-person thoughts exclusive to the higher-level-consciousness.<br/>That's what I mean by everyone is everyone else. By the theory, we are all just one entity that experiences many localized, I-am-me-and-noone-else perspectives. Of course I feel like me, and you feel like you. But that feeling of individual identity does not mean that our experiences are not just the thoughts of one single entity."
