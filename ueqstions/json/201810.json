The first part is incredibly somber and quite frankly depressing, exuding the feeling of exhaustion and trying to trick yourself into going forward (maybe this is just my personal experiences with depression and feeling desperate to keep moving, but the three lines about how far you've gone and then with the \" and it's a long long long long long way back\" to me feels more like a reminder that you can't change your mind now. Instead of being encouraging and motivating, to me it feels daunting and frightening that now you kind of have to keep going forward since you cant go back.) <br/><br/>Regardless of the first bits, the second part se ems to t ake a more positive outlook, especially with the last line with the \"road\" being to success. My best guess is that this song is about struggling to stay either motivated with a project or with life in general, that or it could be about depression and a kind of subliminal encouragement to those suffering that it DOES get better if you keep fighting. Those are my two best guesses. What do you think I'm mighty wurtz?"

(The last series of pairs of weeks has again proved it. Thanks for putting your ideas in my head.) I want to learn how to do the same. I know in my heart and brain that moving my body will have the same effect, but I lack the discipline to even do the thing that I know will help. It has just never been a habit, and so I am less fit and I view it as an \"extra\" thing that is hard to do and wastes the time I already am not using well enough. Has running/moving always been a part of your life, or if you had to develop that habit, how do I get from zero but stay there once I start?"

Then once i figure out the notes from the sheet music it falls under muscle memory and i end up getting technically better with playing the piano but not so great at reading while playing. Should I focus on one more than the other to start or should i keep trying to play as I'm reading?"
