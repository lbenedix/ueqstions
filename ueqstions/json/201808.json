I do have feelings of discomfort like that- which makes it hard for me to do activities that seem a bit scary to me even though it's all in my head. But today was the first time I had actually stooped so low in a very very long time. I was procrastinating on these two simple tasks I told myself to fulfill. Prior to playing my keyboard, I wanted to inspect my approach to music and perhaps change it. And I wanted to draw something original because I find that so scary. Both tasks were scary to me- playing the keyboard and drawing something original. The reason why playing the keyboard to me is scary is because my mind numbs to it and I find it harder to innovate. This makes me feel bad because it makes me feel like an insecure failiure. Drawing something original scares me because I'm the past I've found it to be quite a stress enduring task because I judge my wor k so har shly, I find it difficult to lift myself off the ground and persue an idea because I want it to be so perfect so bad. So both tasks are pretty stress enducing and my procrastination and fear got the best of me. It makes me feel sad. But... procrastinating felt so good that I'm confused to this whole situation. I came to the conclusion this morning that my approach to art was causing unnecessary stress and if I change my approach, art is bound to be more fun for me. But I pussied out! Because I was back in my stupid house that I hate being in and I found it to be so overwhelming I didn't even dare to try. Dammit I'm fucking retarded. ...why is it so hard for me to do this? It honestly upsets me. Oh my god I'm so sorry! I'm apologizing to you and me. Fuck- I could've been out there doing something amazing and getting over these fears but fuck no! All I thought about were those crippling feelings I got out of my past attempts. Ohhhh this is the first time in the past couple day s that I 've actually been this upset. Fuck you tat! Fuck fuck fuck fuck you for being so scared and fuck you for being so unable to change you fucking retarded bitch! Why can't I fucking change myself to actually be the person I dream of??? AAUUGHHHHHHHHHH IM MAD IM MAD IM MAD but you want to hear something? My mind doesn't feel overworked or upset at my dumbass!!! I feel like a piece of shit. You know what? I'm done. Fuck it. I'm going to that damn room and I'm going to create something beautiful. I'm done with this fucking bullshit of sabatoging myself. My punishment for not persuing my fears is to make myself uncomfortable facing my fears. I find that thought quite hillarious for some reason. Anyways I'll be back. Im about to fucking whip my ass and I forgot what other bullshit I was going to say I'm so mad right now BYE"

I'm a survivor by destiny's child was in G#min. speaking of 2000ish 'bye bye bye' is G#min. \"Timber\" by kesha/pitbull was G#min. there are many more that's just what i can think of off the top of my head. oh yeah \"tina turner\" what's love got to do with it, that's G#min. also \"family affair\" mary j. blige is G#min. As for Eb min (D# min) let's see, there was one a few years ago called i \"won't black out\" i forget who it's by... just looked it up that's by breathe carolina. was a big hit around 2009. That rihanna one with chains/whips ..... s&amp;m? that's Eb min for sure. speaking of which, rude boy was also Eb min (also rihanna.) A very popular ballad from around 2002 \"my whole life has changed...\" by ginuwine? that was in Ebmin. Stevie wonder \"i wish\" and \"superstition\" are hugely popular standards, both in Ebmin although many bands play them in E to make it easier for guitars and harder for the singer. Low by flo rida was Eb min. Ain't Nobody by chaka kahn is Ebmin. there are many many more but i'm trying to just stick to the popular ones because that's what you mentioned",

I have an extremely tight group of friends outside of school but I only get to see some on the weekend sometimes. Mum doesn't let me go out of my suburb to see them though that often and most of the time I just have to stay home and talk to them over the phone or text or something. I'm a really introverted person except around my close friends where I really thrive. Around them is the only times I actually feel happy and feel like living. But I only get to feel that way a few days in a month. Every other day is literal hell. I sit in the corner by myself at school listening to music and trudging through ATAR hell and I s pend lun ch breaks sitting in the corner of the common room buried in beanbags. And I just feel like crying all the time those days and I feel like it's just not worth living at all and I'm so empty and sad. I'm too scared to talk to professional counselors or even like those crisis support hotlines and even my own parents and siblings?? I only talk to that group of friends about how I'm feeling but they can't really help all that much apart from just talking to me where it does improve my mood a little. I find you a really good guy to just vent to as well and I'm sorry to force you to read my sad wall of text but yeah idk what to do and I'm just stuck...<br/>"

For a long time, as a songwriter/composer/alien/etc I saw my lyrics as simply a vessel for the vocal melody, and resented the the listeners' inevitable search Deeper Meaning where there wasn't any. I've ultimately decided that's a cowardly way to go about things, so now I'm stuck. Meaningful words don't come to me through the ether in the same way that music does. <br/>"
