Usually, I follow the same kinda mindset as you've said before of \"trying to fit the chord/instrumentation that supports the melody/song at the time\" (I think, it's been a while!) But I haven't been able to ever make a trill on either a brass instrument or a piano or keyboard to sound anything but really really jarring against the rest of the song... In your song \"this is a song for my next album\" you end the song with a really excellent trill on a keyboard that just Feels So Natural to the rest of the track! I absolutely know that I should be looking to find the instrumentation that supports the track as best as possible rather than Trying To Fit something that doesn't belong (as like forcing yourself to shoehorn a particular chord) but I feel like at this point there's just something that I'm fundamentally missing with my execution of a trill that always leads to it clashing Every Time. Any ideas on what might be my issue, or any tips that might help point me in the right direction? Thanks!"

Rock on\" and I just keep staring at him and I look to my grandma and to him and I'm sure I looked like I was going insane and then he starts talking again and he's like \"I even love that stupid octopuses garden song\" and I'm like \"bill?\" And he's like \"what\" and my grandma is like \"no it was the other guy in the Beatles who wrote that song\" and then he gets in an argument with my grandma about who wrote that song and I'm just standing there watching him scan my grandmas adult diapers and scream at her and in my head I'm thinking \"THIS IS BILL FUCKING WURTZ or possibly his twin brother that lives in Florida AND HE KNOWS ALL THE SECRETS TO THE UNIVERSE\" because he was winning the argument and I assumed he knew everything else as well. and basically: this shook me, bill."

(telomeres shorten after each cell replication). I don't know if you'll post this but I think it's cool info that people don't hear about unless they search for it specifically"

I make the notation in a notation program, and screenshot it. (then i actually make several alignment adjustments in graphics, because notation programs are incredibly finicky, it's easier to adjust things in graphics)... then i save it how i want. then i use graphics to erase the last note (and any chord that goes along with it.) i erase notes on a staff by just dragging empty staff over it. and i \"save as\" and then add a 1 to the file name. repeat, keep erasing the next note and 'save as'. then you have a stack of files all in order. then import. then allign the timing. it's the exact same way i do text, but with text i type it out and screenshot each frame, and delete words (easier, instead of erasing them). the delete technique would not work in a notation program, because the notes and alignment will change as you delete them. that's why i use graphics. it's not that hard, and i'm not even using a graphics program. just an image preview program, and i'm just copying and pasting boxes. the mccartney video was a bit more ambitious because i wanted to do a steady scroll. so i thought it would be good to make one huge image file that is the entire length of the score. and then do the erase per frame technique.... so then all the frames were huge... and then export that to a really high res video and scroll the video??? i don't remember if this was successful, but you run into major problems when you try to do huge things like that. processing power limitations, etc. Same sort of crisis occured when i was trying to do the zoom out on the japanese army. i ended up having to somehow break the task into smaller pieces. if i recall. i somehow succeeded in getting a steady scroll on the notation, only to find out that it was too hard to read when it's moving like that!! so i ended up keeping it still and then sliding forward page by page. if i had known the steady scroll wasn't going to work, i probably would have broken it into pages from the start",
