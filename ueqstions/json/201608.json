There are too many books to read, songs to discover, plays/films to watch. So much to learn. And such little time. Also the stupid but inescapable notion that nothing I create will be Good Enough, and other silly reasons that I keep putting it off like the decision about which tools to focus on becoming better at playing around with first. Words? Musical instruments? Cameras? I want to do it all but also sometimes I don't want to do anything.How does one consume less and create more?"

Is the forementioned distopia-like situation a ridiculous extreme? Would people be willing to accept the concept of a country stagnant in population growth over the personal shock of being limited to  only on e or two children? How would the classes face this problem differently? Would the same laws apply to them, or would they be eligible to pay a hefty sum for the right to have anadditional child/children?
