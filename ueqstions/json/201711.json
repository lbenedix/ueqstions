Is it true that the songwriters usually make more money than the singer of the tune does? I think it happens a lot that songwriters and the session musicians aren't really credited on the albums. This isn't new either. You look at like old motown records or something and all you see is the name of the singer. When I find an instrumental part I really like, it's always a chore to figure out who was actually playing on that album. Although I guess nowadays, pop artists don't really make most of their money through album sales and stuff like that anymore."
