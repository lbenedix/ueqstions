But I think maybe there might. Like, I turned on the mic and thought out loud it for 52 minutes and thinking of it being able to be as a standalone thing that's releasable. And I keep thinking but i think its maybe just a bit less tiring to do it without that extra minigame. Do you think that minigame should be the norm? that i should strive to be as entert aining/e fficient thoughtwise even when the mics off. Now if that were the case, wouldn't that make my aspiration to have every thought be content? Then how would I organize that, and when? I think maybe theres a benefit of only turning it on in certain times and be able to verbalize what has been inner dialogue only for a while, and that in itself can be an interesting display of words over time. <br/>I'd like to invite you to be the first listener of the first outloud thought session. (the whole what the hell is a podcast thing rubbed off on me which is why ive avoided the word throughout this, i realize i have a similar thing with \"philosophizing\", its just thinking really, the proper way perhaps, although thats already adding a bit of my biases).<br/><br/>I think not thinking of it as a podcast would limit myself to thinking \"you cant release 3 today!\" If i felt like recording 3 outloud thought sessions in a day. because that doesn't fit my idea of what a podcast is, and  that ma y bias the way i do what i do and how i do it or even worse, how i think of it.<br/><br/>Turns out i came here to ask about why not release unedited reality footage but i really just wanted to talk about my first time doing something that felt natural since I am still riding that high. <br/><br/>Hope you're having a bunch of fun and fulfilment playing around with your process and thanks for doing what you do and how you do it, i wouldnt be able to think doing whatever made sense if i didnt see you make sense of whatever you do.<br/><br/>I'd normally go back and add parenthesis to afterthoughts but ive learned its more pure when the words are chronologically put where they are."

But all this is slightly false because the numbers are actually supposed to be hexidecimal. which means instead of 0123456789, it's 0123456789abcdef. so 00 is the least and ff is the most. so 00FF00 is full green, 0000FF is full blue, 0000EE is almost full blue, and FFFFFF is full white. 888888 is grey. 995555 would be grey with a slightly reddish tint. 'A' comes after 9, so AA5555 would be the same but slightly more red. etc",
