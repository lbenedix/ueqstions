        "q": "Looking back at the description of the Japan video, you said there was 1 day on temp narration and then on to the graphics, and then jingles. Just so I'm clear, are you currently on graphics?"

        "q": "You might be asked like thirty times before you write a response but in case you haven't, Vine had just announced that they are discontinuing their service in the coming months. They'll keep old videos online. I remember back before History of Japan you were kinda in a love-hate relationship with Vine because it allowed you to trim and really concentrate your content, but doing so was kinda addicting(?) in a way and it sorta stagnated you from making longer videos until you made the bold move to cut Vine off entirely during HoJ production. I'm sorry if this question seems to be spiraling out of control or maybe I'm just rambling, but I'm curious to understand why Vine was an appealing outlet for your content at the time and if you've \"grown out\" of it and don't mind the discontinuation too much or if you still have some fondness for that service.
