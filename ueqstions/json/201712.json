I know normality doesnt exist, but i think you might have some ideas about whats the \"normal\" way of expressing oneself (in which, to my standarts, you dont follow). Am I looking into it too much? Maybe you are \"joking around\" as people say. I think that what I tried to ask is: how would you define yourself from a more understandable (to other people in general) point of view?. man im sorry (since i dont even speak english), it feels impossible to communicate with the ambiguity of almost everything around us, and maybe your ambiguity called more my attentio n than o ther ambiguities (because its easier to notice). thank you for reading, i hope i made some sense"

Also, the other very simple reason why everyone always says that things are never is good as they used to be is just simple nostalgia. everything always seems perfect in the past. we forgive anything for sucking. and finally a 3rd reason even though i only said i was going to give 2, a 3rd reason is if you actually are a musician/artist or someone who deeply wishes to succeed, it can just boil down to jealousy and envy. and i just thought of a 4th reason, people engage in pop-hate as a way to fit in. if you bad-mouth something new, you are less likely to receive resistence because it less likely that that piece has accumulated a sizeable body of respect in society",
        "q": "Why do you think 'pop hate' is such a common thing? Specifically with music too, there doesn't seem to be nearly as much hate directed towards 'popular' movies or books or art, etc. I always hear/read those 'music was so much better back in the day' things too, when a lot of those bands that people loved from 'back in the day' were pop bands (i.e. the beatles). Sorry, long rambling question.. but I don't know, just curious what your thoughts are on all this stuff."
