Ok, that being said, starting in 2011 i actually learned how to write using a keyboard and voice memo recordings. for a long time i didn't do this because i didn't know how to brainstorm and keep it organized, but i finally figured out how to do it, and wrote like this ever since -- including the massive amount of revisions and updates i made to the existing song catalog during 2012-13. basically there is a master text file, which has a lyric sheet, and every part has a reference audio file that goes with it -- so the text will have the lyric, and then at the end of the stanza or whatever, it would say \"see audio 27.mov\" and that would be just a desk recording of me demoing how it goes, and perhaps giving other instructions or indications of how to deliver it. sometimes even when the song is done, i might do a paste-together of all these demos, or just do a full run through with a click. occasionally i still might use paper, especially if i have a bridge or something that has really interesting changes, but these days i find it's not even worth it -- does not make for easy access, because it would be buried in a book somewhere and i can't 'search' for the file. Before recording a song, i find it very helpful to make a \"studio chart\" which is actually just mainly a chord chart, and it also has specific rhythmic indications of when to play certain chords (particularly when certain chords need to be anticipated)",

On vines, this really doesn't apply, or also on those dense all-chord jingles in history of japan. Those are all being written note for note when i first write it. and it's become a very sensitive thing. a jingle like \"it's time for world war 1\" i will be sitting at the keyboard meticulously trying different things until the chords are exactly right. And then when i record it, it's pretty simple -- you just sing all the notes of the chords, (taking various other basic considerations). doing vines 7 days a week really accelerated my vocal harmony game, and i'm looking forward to doing much much more of it in the future",

        "a": "i started experimenting with borrowing \"road maps\" from other songs. i did this only in july and august 2011. everyone always says \"hit songs are all just bits and pieces of older hit songs, put together in a new way... and hopefully doesn't steal the exact melody\" ... I never really liked the idea of borrowing anything delibarately, and i had never tried it before .... but then at some point i was listening to paul mccartney (or maybe it was john lennon's covers record, of songs from the 50s??) when suddenly i realized, ..... these guys are using existing forms all the time!! and people have been doing it since the beginning of time. like blues forms ... 12 bars, and you go to the 4 chord at that exact time, and it wraps up in the end.  It's not always exactly the same, but those important plot-points are there. or Haikus for example. everyone's using the same structure, and it frees you up to be creative within that world. So i figured, why don't i just try writing songs that use the same \"road map\" as other songs i know. and by road map, i wanted to take the exact section length.  like the exact verse length, exact chorus length, ... keep the interlude length the same, ... and hit all the \"important\" chords at the same time. like, get to the 1 chord at the same time. if the chorus starts on the 5 chord... start the chorus on the 5 chord. Basically what i mean is, use the entire chord form of the whole song, but you don't need to actually play every chord the same, you just need to follow the map. Like if you are basing your picture off a duck, and you are drawing a horse, but you put the head in the same part of the page, and the body in the same part of the page. and also was very careful to approach all the melodies from different angles so none of my melodies are the same. So i decided to try it, and wrote a few songs that way. \"do what you want to do,\" \"all u need is love,\" and \"stupid song (in my car)\" were written that way. \"it's gonna be alright\" originally started this way, but the chorus deviates from the form. \"do what you want to do\" does not use the bridge from the form, and \"all u need is love\" the form song had no bridge, so i made my own from scratch. \"stupid song\" is just a loop, but the section lengths still correspond, and the simple fact that there are 3 sections, and one of the sections pretty much has only 1 word in it. These are important building blocks, and it was a good exercise to try to use an existing \"frame.\" i actually made a list of about 800 potential \"frame\" songs to use, and even came up with some pretty elaborate details on what considerations to make and what approaches to take for each one. but after aug 2011 i never used this method again ..... Maybe because the songs turned out to be too boring, and i wanted to do more exciting things.",

        "a": "this was during a brief period of time when i was actually trying to write in the studio . ...  from the beginning of 2011, all i wanted to do was try more \"normal\" songs (maybe with verse / cho? maybe with just some simple looping chord changes?) also potentially written in the studio. (i eventually concluded that this is a terrible idea for me). experiments in this phase include \"when is it time to come home again\" \"how am i sposed\" and \"do the thing\" .... basically in all 3 cases, i sort of set up the chord vamp, and then i had a text file open and very spontaneously, the lyrics+melody materialized out of thin air. very basic lyrics, very basic melodies. i just let it follow the path of least resistance. \"do the thing\" is really like a, 'ok universe, i'm ready to go. please show me the way, take me where i'm supposed to go, i'm ready to see what i need to see now.' ... like a real \"surrenduring to the sky\" type of thing. honestly, after doing so many complex-weird songs with surprises and weird backflips in 2010, i was ready to try the total opposite. so you get this zoned out, almost dead feeling -- for example the huge gap in the lines in the first verse. also, the \"i love you\" song was recorded at the same time, and that also subscribes to this ultra-dead zoned out feel. was trying this out, probably mostly as a reaction to some of the madness that ensued in all the 2010 songs (only about 10% of which ever got recorded, by the way). So that's what you have for the verses of 'do the thing' (and by the way, 'do the thing' is not a good title, i kept changing the title and never really found the right title for that song). for the bridge, i sort of reverted to \"writing mode,\" stopped the session, and turned to the writing keyboard / paper, and wrote a bridge -- vastly diff. key, probably thinking in \"mccartney\" mode. trying to do a really \"special\" bridge. -- by the way, this is also exactly the same strategy for the \"what love is\" bridge -- stop the session, turn to the book and write a bridge. I don't really have a good explaination for why the last verse of \"do the thing\" might feel different, to me it was just common sense to arrive at that place. you can feel a little bit of impatience setting in, like \"i'll wait forever if i have to\" sort of thing. you know, it's that feeling when you are talking to the sky and you know it's the most important conversation ever, but at the same time, ... you might doubt if it even hears you. The tempo decrease makes it seem even more \"dying.\" i was trying new things, again, breaking away from the ultra-complicated, surprise-based writing, and looking to go outside the box on the simple end instead. Go to the store probably goes even further in that direction.",

      {
        "a": "pretty good, but there are a few mistakes, some more important than others.the sus2's you have at the beginning of the verses are not really strictly obeyed. that's just kind of the way i played it. i would honestly just think \"Eb\" or \"Ab.\" 2's will sneak in, that would be a players choice. and surely there will be times where you can catch me playing 2's and 3's at the same time. but that's not too important.The next thing i see is at the end of the first stanza, after \"never coming back\" -- the Ebsus4's you have written -- it should include a 2 also.  however you choose to say that (Ebsus2,4?? sus4,2??who knows). the first mistake that actually matters is the Bb7 on connecticut. it's Bb7sus4. actually there's a C note in there too. but NO D. i can firmly say in this song you will not hear Ab and D notes played at the same time. when i use D in the chord, it's just a Bb triad (as you have correctly noted, mostly).  so that's a Bb7sus4 or Bb9sus4. (or Fmin7 over Bb if that's not too confusing)ok moving on, the pickup notes on \"oh, i'm\" i would definitely specify the bass notes there -- Ab/C, Bb/D.immediately after that, you said Gm on \"canaan\", and it's absolutely not Gm, it's Eb/G. on \"have a good time\" again, it's Bb7sus4 not Bb or Bbsus2. also for what it's worth, the Ab in that line was played as an \"add-2\" but that is not important, that's just player's choice.  and again, the oscilating chords in the vamp after \"good time\" includes 2 AND 4.ok, looks good through the train verse, again the 'sus2's are optional and could go either way.  \"Turn\" i see you had a question mark. in most of your question mark situations, the magic note here is B. in this case, it is Bb7sus4b9. so again, i stress the fact that there is no D. but there is a B. call it Abmin6 over Bb, call it Bb7sus4b9, whatever. the magic note is B, and there's no D. and there is a Bb (it's in the melody!)Chorus looks good, just triads, Good job recognizing the Cmin7 (and not Eb) on \"blue\"!! i always get paranoid that people might not \"feel\" the 6 bass in those situations when there is no bass. i am glad it came across.  on 'You', the sus4 and major really blend together. if i was playing guitar in the key of E, i would be playing B and letting that high E string ring and blend together. but, close enough.on \"feel, for, you\" i have to nitpick. that is Ab, then Eb/G, then Fmin7. beat by beat. at no point is there Ab/G.last chord before the \"countryside\" verse, is again Bb7sus4b9. the passing chord after \"i can find\" --  here's how that works -- the bass is playing A. another important note in the chord is B. the way to really execute this properly is to include G, B, and Eb in the chord, and the bass plays A. call it Gaug over A, call it A9b5, call it Ebaug7 over A, whatever (Db note probably wouldn't hurt in there.) but listening to the reality of what happened, it looks like at least one of the keyboards is not adhering to this. you can hear the B note, but it looks like someone is still playing a Bb note on the transition chord. and guess what, it goes by so fast it does not matter. in plenty of \"band\" situations, the bass player might choose to play this passing A, and they keyboard/guitar players might not know or care, and it still sounds just find because it goes by so fast. on \"shade\", again this is Bb7b9sus4 (or again, Abmin6 over Bb. same thing)ok, now clearly you have identified something strange happening here on this chord before the bridge (before \"i'm gonna go to starbucks\"). the first thing i will say is, it is NOT a 4 chord. the 4 chord is where you are going-- this chord would be the equivalent of a Eb7. more specifically, Ebaug7. there is clearly an F note in there too. you might even call it Gaug7. there might not be a Db. Again, one of the keyboards is somehow still playing a Bb note, which might be \"illegal\" but it doesn't seem to cause any problems. again, the important note is B, and it's basically just Eb+7. the bass for some reason is allowed to riff freely on Ebmaj pentatonic, not caring about the B nat, because for some reason that's just the way it works. it's a transitionary moment, and you can get away with this.on \"starbucks/ukulele\" i should comment that the Absus4 is just as legal as it would have been in the \"harlem\" part, ... it looks like i used it a little less in the 'starbucks' part, although i do hear one of the strings playing that Db note on \"play my\".on \"Sky\", again, this is Bb7sus4. and right before \"going\" the keys slip in that b9 (B note). on \"going\" with the melody on G, this chord is really happiest emphasizing that G. seems like Abmaj9 with both C and Bb included. on \"feels\", AGAIN it's Bb7sus4b9. and again, the vamp oscilation is Ebsus2 and 4 together.in the last chorus, there are a couple of bass choices that might be worth pointing out in the chords, but you could just blame that on bass player choices. \"dream, of, you\" once again is Ab, then Eb/G, then Fmin7 (not Ab/G). and again, for \"say\", it is Bb7sus4b9. out vamp is correct. near the end, the bass thinks it's doing like a Bdim to Cmin thing, but the keys don't care. so that is probably not even worth writing down.  overall, great job",

Sure, you can make great and crazy sounds with audio, but i am not a soundsmith. my strength is in the notes, chords, and thankfully i have now found a way to put words into the mix as well. Recording using audio would be an entirely different animal. an entirely different world. a great world, but completely, completely different. it's about as likely for me to suddenly switch to that as it is for me to suddenly become a professional golfer.  also, i think this midi approach has a lot of advantages if you have to work alone. i can fly around between different instruments and make adjustments very quickly, which cushions the damage of the 'alone problem' -- the problem where the first instrument can't hear the later instruments being played and can't react to them. Sure, in audio you can do 'punches' but it still seems limited, and it's just a whole diffent game, plus you probably also need more processing power and i have zero life experience working that way, or thinking that way. i've been doing midi since i was 10. for my situation, the advantages of using midi are insane. The only instrument i use audio for is the vocal, because you have to. and that's more than enough to manage. also with recording audio, you have to actually worry about sound quality, mic quality, all kinds of stuff. and these are things that i have Never worried about. I have been made to feel guilty on multiple occasions for using MIDI, and i used to feel guilty about it then, but then i realized that i have heard plenty of artists use MIDI in amazing ways, so at a certain point i really started to embrace it and never looked back. the thing that i probably envy most in the audio world is stuff like strumming guitars, etc. I do think it is eventually worth it to try to conquer the audio mountain in order to include some of those things, but it would be a huge huge change, and require me to learn to think and function in entirely new ways. also you would now have to worry about guitar quality!! worry about the strings, worry about intonation, worry about amps maybe, worry about miking, on and on, more and more issues that i have never even touched. not to mention another even bigger issue: working with other people.  using audio would require me to go back to the stone age in many, many, many ways. and i would do it immediately if i could live forever. perhaps i would also become a molecular biologist",

(string-writing, or chain-writing ... train-writing .. whatever you want to call it). So i just hit the page, and 'the road' came out. i just went wherever i wanted to go, and the whole thing stays about equal melodic and harmonic density, yet without any real repeating patterns of any kind. changes keys all over the place. a fun time to get really frisky with key changes. might be inspired by some of the crazier donald fagan writing. the lyrics just came out automatically.  everything changes after the \"now i know\" part .... and i'm not sure exactly what that means. in a song like this about \"searching\" it might seem surprising to eventually \"find\" the thing! but it just happened. and the mood sounds a bit strange after that, especially converging on the last line (which i didn't know was going to be the title until the end) .... almost feels like i'm saying everything's fine and i found my way, but it's obvious listening to the harmonic mood that something's not totally cool.",

Somtimes, I get on a roll of \"just doing it\" (like what u said about demon-killing songs), and it feels so, so great! The experience stacks up, and slowly things start feeling smoother, it flows. But at some point I will always look back at the first recordings and think, \"that was a good song, but it's recorded terribly. Maybe I should go back...\" and that halts the whole flow. I guess there's no real answer to this situation, but I'm wondering if, besides the demon-killing, did you set yourself any \"limits\" too? Like, \"once a song is recorded, that's it\"? It takes so much willpower to do, but I guess sometimes songs n eed to b e used as fuel to kindle the fire of future songs. Or something. It's hard!!!"

I try to tell myself to just shut the fuck up and work hard on something that I think is good and important and make it as good as I can and when IÕm done with it, share it. Self-promotion should be the last step, not the first.

(if i can say everything i want to say in 3, that would be fine too. if it takes 15, ...... i guess that's fine too.) japan clocked in at exactly 9 minutes on the first timed run through. i am also working on this video every day, every available hour (just like the last one.) The main difference between this time and last time is this: during the 14 weeks that it took to make history of japan, i was also writing and creating short videos for vine Every Single Day for about the first 2/3 of the time i was working on history of japan. so that would be maybe about half the work time each day devoted to vine, and NOT the history video. Now i am not doing that. so that would be a significant reason why this video might get done faster. Also, after making history of japan, i have refined some of my techniques a bit more, and might be able to work faster.  However, the scope of this topic is a bit different, which might present some unforseen challenges. There is also a small chance that I may decide to make a short video just to have Something to release during the long haul (although i might NOT do that, because that will only directly delay the release of the long video.) The good news is, i have a 1 minute song and music video already completed which i am waiting to upload. i am saving it for when i am deep in the depths of production on this long video, so i have something to release. i hope that answers your question",

      {
        "a": "news flash.... the fact that you \"don't want\" to learn \"music theory\" is a sneak preview that you are not going to learn it if you expect someone else to teach it to you. that's just the nature of \"music theory\" and/or ... the nature of learning in general, i think! you can't just go to the doctor and get a 'shot' of 'music theory' and know it. besides ..... it doesn't really exist!! the way \"music\" \"theory\" (if there is such a thing) works is .... it's really just how you choose to make sense of the musical world you live in.  Every \"music theory\" class really is just an extrapolation of what seems to be the principles among a CERTAIN SET of music that was popular during a certain time period.  If you go to a classical school, they will teach you things that relate to what was popular in europe several centuries ago. if you go to berklee, they will probably teach you a lot about what was popular in the 1940s. there could be a class based on only the last 20 years of music, and it would be different still. there is really only a small amount of stuff that is really actually established and unchanging. like note names -- europe named the notes with letters a few centuries ago, and it really stuck. the entire world uses those notes. do you know them? (A, Bb, B, C, etc)i've known many many musicians in my life, and also many people who were in music school, and anyone who really gets how music works did not learn it from a class. they may have been in a class, but what is really going to give you the knowledge is going to come from you. and it will need to happen in your own way. in other words, i have absolutely never met anyone that had music theory entirely 'bestowed' or given to them from only an outside source. i've said this many times, but really the best way to go about it is from the context of music you know and like. Learn that music! learn how to play it. learn how to play those melodies. learn how to play those chords. (and don't expect a chord to always have 3 notes or always be next to each other!) Learn the music you already know. you Will find principles, and you will get to know them very well. THEN, later on, perhaps you will stumble upon a music textbook or something, and 'take a glance' inside, ... and you will probably start to find things that you are familiar with, and maybe you will learn a name or 2.  But really that's just learning the names of something you already knew. That won't actually make you 'better,' it only helps in the sense that it helps you communicate with other musicians in a working situation. But that only goes so far, because the majority of musicians (including professionals) really don't know 'official music theory' that deeply, regardless of how experienced they may be. Again, there really is no 'official music theory' beyond a couple very small things -- note names ...  and key signatures i guess. Everything else will be stylistically catered to the way music might have been played at a certain time in history. so that is why you are best off approaching it from exactly the standpoint that you are used to. i hope that answers your question",
        "q": "I'm not really that good at writing music but I like to make it anyway. I've been using GarageBand for instrumentals and Notes for lyrics. I don't think it'll amount to anything and I sometimes wonder if I took music theory classes, which I don't want to take, whether I would get better and whether it would be worth it. Basically what it boils down to is \"do I want to waste my time doing something that will help in the long run but that I really don't want to do and that I don't need or do I want to teach myself and get better agonizingly slowly but have a lot more fun doing it\""

You often mention feelings of loneliness, and I wonder if this is actually how you feel, or if it's part of the self-deprecating humour routine. It boggles me, because you seem absolutely content with being alone, and I know that personally, if I had the chance to meet you or even write together, I would grab it immediately. As a girl freshly graduated from college and trying to figure out the path of sharing my ideas with the world, watching what you do is inspiring to me. So thank you for doing what you love, and thank you for giving it out for others to see. :)"

(which by the way, i do appear in some of). so overall i don't think there is a very convincing argument that i stopped. although it is true that during the time when the 2 day schedule was going up to vine, there were people who indicated that they were tired of seeing me every other day. but there was nothing i could do about it, because i was uploading all the videos in order. i do think it is important to appear in videos reasonably often, because i don't want it to be shocking when i do",

So far 3 song picks have been made, the first one was about 50% done, the second one was 100% done but i changed part of it, and the third one was really just a short (very traditional) chord form with barely a dummy melody, and i finished and wrote the whole thing.

The list may change, and i am trying very hard to resist the hammering from the public to \"just do another history video\" and i am trying very hard to remember that no one was asking for a history video before i did it (they wanted vines forever), and that following through in my own way is what made that what it was, and i am trying to remember to continue operating like that.",

'run' never got recorded.      much later, in 2013 during a year-long writing sweep, both of those songs came up for evaluation/re-write/delete consideration. 'run' actually got split into 2 songs -- i basically separated the 'run' part and called that its own song (run), and then i took the 'looking glass' part and added a new ending, ('elf') which actually carries on the original narrative and explains more details about the 2010 writing session (fine morning in brooklyn, etc etc). 'write me another' also got a 2013 evaluation (which was unusual for already recorded songs, but for some reason i thought it was worth looking at) and one of the possible endings i was looking at was \"i'm gonna plan my day\"... but that line ended up being its own thing. another option was 'i just wrote a song and it made no sense, i'm here outside the brooklyn museum, etc etc\" and that is the one i ended up going with. so, again, this actually explains more details about the original situation, despite the fact that that part was actually written years later.      later still, in 2014, when i was doing 4 videos a week and 1 song every wednesday, the new version of \"just wrote a song (now called brooklyn museum)\" got recorded. so as a result, there are 2 recordings that start with the exact same line (i just wrote a song) one recorded in 2010 and one recorded in 2014. the 'i'm gonna plan my day' bit also got picked for a wednesday during 2014. also, the 'elf' bit  got picked. it's important to remember that during 2014, i had to pick short songs way too often, because there just wasn't enough time to do anything of length, and anything short that was any good got picked earlier in the year, so by september (or whenever it was) i was only left with the worst ones (like these ones, or macys, or whatever). basically i'm apologizing for this crap. it was all written way before i knew what i was doing (2010), and through a series of circumstances ended up being recorded, hastily. i hope that makes sense",

Not on ly am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little \"clever\" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.</a>"
