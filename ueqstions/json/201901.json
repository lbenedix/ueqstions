I'm telling myself that I'll catch up and I shouldn't be jealous of those who've had more experience. But there's a little voice in my head that tells me that it's too late, I've missed my shot, I can't become good at anything starting age 17 and I should just give up. Now I can't say if this is true, but if it is please tell me and I'll just go back to studying to become an engineer, which is 1000x less fulfilling but at least I'm good at it"

In that case you would be like a movie director directing the editor. But also the master because any editor you hire would have to go through an apprenticeship to understand your methods. Also, it would finally be a good time for you to update your software because the editor would be using the new software so he would teach you about it while you tutor him on your process.

And then the second guitar comes in and harmonizes over the first and I figured out that the harmony is a minor third (correct me if im wrong). But here's the confusion: the notes in the harmony are A D C# E, and A D E are all a minor third of the corresponding notes in guitar 1 - F# B C#. BUT the C# in guitar 2 is a MAJOR THIRD away from the A in guitar 1. And it sounds bloody cool.

Science actually becomes more useless the more fundamental you get, so a TOE would actually be the ultimate useless thing. There are many many things (in fact, the overwhelming majority of things in this world) that a TOE would not actually explain because no one outside of string theorists actually do science from first principles (deriving everything from quantum mechanics, etc). People just try to come up with models that fit their data. Please ask me if you need me to elaborate on any of this."

'bad thing' was excluded way earlier, because it was one of the least good. so after having eventually excluding them all for not being good enough, i realized i was at a dead end and the clock was running out so for a twist i just kind of picked one of the worst ones, and wrote it extremely quickly. this was actually an advantage, because when you try to make a bad thing good in a very short amount of time, you are forced to bring out your very best. it's kind of like when it's 8:59 and the bread store is closing at 9:00, you will discover some automobile maneuvering skills you perhaps didn't know you had, just to get that bread",

About four years ago I finally stepped into making and singing music after growing up in an family that believed music making, esp singing, is the realm of an elite few talented people. I always rebelled against this idea in my heart because but didn't participate in misic making until I left that environment about 4 yrs ago. anyways, after 4 years of singing w a vocal group I could just feel that my voice, my ears, improv and other abilities had become quite strong. About 6 mo ago I leveled up again in my understanding of music and began making/recording my own music and performing more on my own time, not just with my group. So, I know my strongest suit is harmony and singing with others, but recently at a mic night I sang a song (used a mic) by myself, no accompanymnent, which is a first for me. Icould hear myself during and it I was delighted that my voice both sounded and felt good, which i have learned are some of several markers that you are making a good, strong sound. But a friend recorded it, then sent it to me later. I watched it to see what it sojnded like from an audiences persective and it actually didn't sound great, not bad but not good. There were a few notes I thought I nailed but were actually a little shaky, and overall tone was not as strong as I had felt it was in the moment. This devastates me because my body and my ears to ears told me it sounded nice while I was performing, but the actual recorded audio denies this...I feel shattered. So now I am wondering if I should just halt all my musical persuits,"

But now, i've realized college doesn't help me learn anything and also college sucks and i hate it.So basically, i'm a 5-year-old trapped in a young adult's body. i know that once i start being myself and fully commit to it, there will be no turning back to the old way of thinking, and i'm honestly completely okay with that, except i'm naturally a more \"out-there\" person than most people and many people i know, (including professors) can and have seen my assertiveness and certainty as disrespect or rudeness. I've requested a solo room so i can be a weirdo and make content in there without anyone judging me, so that's at least a start i guess. Point is, i'm going to change eventually, but the question is just time. My gut is telling me to break out of this mentality now, the sooner the better.

Although music is your main thing you've mostly delivered it on a single to single basis or taking part in a preexisting narrative. Not asking for an album here (which you mostly consider to be a collection of songs in a specific order), but a longer than usual continuous piece of music, a musical journey in itself which takes the world again by surprise and reafirms them your place as a music person. Many people have the wrong idea that your main thing is history vids just because these are your biggest most ambitious pieces of content, and it seems to them everything else is just the inbetweens of your hist ory proj ects.
