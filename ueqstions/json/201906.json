        "a": "it seems like exactly the average of tempos i might use. but then again it depends how you notate it. any tempo could technically be considered its double or its half. so in that sense, the tempo spectrum actually becomes a circle",
        "q": "Is it slower than your usually favoured tempos on account of the subject matter? Is it interestingly faster than some other material despite the subject matter?"
      },
      {
        "a": "actually doubling a bass octave is usually pretty safe, and doesn't really change the harmonic information much. anything else besides an octave, will be mud town. a general rule of thumb can be discovered .... whatever the lowest single note is that doesn't sound muddy, (let's say it's the lowest C on a 5-string bass, which is about like 32hz or something), i think you'll find that you can octave double that just fine without mud. and the next thing you'll find is that the lowest you can really go safely with a 5th interval is right there in the next octave: C64 and G98 will work fine together, and pack seemingly the same *girth* as the low C. and just the same, a fourth at G98 and C131, will be about the lowest you can take a perfect 4th before it starts to turn to mud. just the same, for the major third, the lower limit will be right here at C131 and E165. following just the same after that, the lowest limit for the minor third will appear to be right there around E165 and G196. none of this is a hard set in stone lower interval limit (these are called LILs in some social circles) but you can notice that they are easily a function of the harmonic series, which is what happens when you take a note and keep doubling the frequency. that low C (32), then C64, then G98, then C131, then E165, G196, the next one is actually a weird half flat 7th, and so on etc etc. interesting phenomenon but the point is that the lower you go, the more simple the interval has to be or else it will turn to mud, and then if you go too low then only 5ths will work and then if you go even lower only single notes will work, and if you go below like low B or maybe A? even single notes turn to mud. i personally think it's more like B. the lowest note on an acoustic piano is A and i really can't hear a note there, it sounds like a noteless grind",
        "q": "<a href=\"https://billwurtz.com/questions/q.php?date=201906280510\">6.28.19  5:10 am</a>  First I'd like to say in regards to <a href=\"https://billwurtz.com/questions/q.php?date=201906280510\">6.28.19  5:10 am</a> , I think my core confusion was that more=better when voicing (and then being too indecisive to know what to cut off for fear of dropping out anything \"good\" by dropping anything out and taking more=better to the extreme of 4 notes per hand for beef purposes, and somehow perceiving the chord root a third below where it was supposed to be for one of them, perhaps because i was voicing stuff so high that I didnt have a grounding bass sound, not trying to make excuses, just trying to pinpoint my mistakes and the core belief behind to more efficiently improve. <br/><br/>Anyways back to chord talk.I really like that bass 2 octaves below, I find i rarely try going around those ranges when playing in my midi keyboard and it can really do a loooot to beef up smaller chords that may be playin g on rig ht hand. For some reason when I do go that low I usually double that octave but through listening to these clear examples i can see how it can actually unbeef the lowest note."
      },
      {
        "a": "you'd be fine if you played them both at the exact same time. the vibratos should be syncronized",
        "q": "Because if the patch im playing with say has any vibrato, tremolo, or even chorusing or other dsp, by doubling the octave you wouldn't necessarily get that extra punch at the desired frequencies because there'd be way more noise (noise as in many more frequencies besides the fundamental, not really all-frequencies-noise) because of the nature of timbre and that could muddy up the low end."

      {
        "a": "1 octave down is a friendly place to be on a 61 key keyboard if you are playing by yourself and you want to take care of the bass. super cool if you get a bass split, then you can play with just a drummer and a singer and it's almost like you've completed the band. takes some practice but if you throw yourself into a situation where you have to do that, you'll sprout wings! like jumping off a cliff. very fun",
        "q": "When trying out the stuff you mentioned i put it an octave down and will be able to jam at a happier harmonic space."

      },
      {
        "a": "a fun secret of chords and chord playing is leaving out the bass note. sometimes if you want that extra thickness, fine you can have it, but i actually find when i'm playing by myself and i am covering the chord and the bass, i play the bass note in the right hand almost 0% of the time. actually much easier the think that way. there are a few cases where i do use it. and now that i think about it, most of those cases where i do use it are cases where there are still only 3 notes in the right hand",
        "q": "and trying the second as u suggested with Bb 58 and C D F starting at middle c. Do you think you stray away from also playing Bb right below middle c wit h your r ight hand because of the most reasonable note to fit in a happy harmonic place within the context of the current notes is the root and its already in the bass?"
      },
      {
        "a": "3 notes in the mid range, plus a bass note, is super great. 4 is super cool too. if we were to start listening to every song on the planet in random order, and go through and check how many notes are in each chord, in the mid and bass range, i'm pretty sure we would find that by far the most common case is 3 or 4 notes in the mid range, and 1 in the bass. that even includes the melody",

      },
      {
        "a": "super classic. reminds me essentially of \"you are everything and everything is you\" and hundreds of others. this means you're in the key of Eb by the way. start playing melodies in Eb and you'll see that i mean. songs with these chords always have the melody in Eb",
        "q": "I thought i might add some more chords to those 2 to practice and get your thoughts with a bigger context so this is what i came up with to get a complete harmonic idea. https://imgur.com/Dx5oEck"

      {
        "a": "yep",

      },
      {
        "a": "well remember, you don't even have a melody yet. like you're making a movie, you've designed the entire set, and now you are worring about which flowers to use, but you haven't even looked at the script yet. let's not get ahead of ourselves. What's the scene about! only then will it matter which direction to point that little flower",

        "a": "oh that's right, it's those chords",
        "q": "I like the 4 notes on right hand as its the first measure and maybe it reinforces the one, but at the same time i think Bb could be better off not there for several contexts. To have a clear one, lets say we're singing never gonna give you up's f irst ver se."

        "a": "ah, 3 more dictionary-like photos. of Abmaj9, Abmaj7, and Eb/Ab (\"Eb over Ab\")",

      },
      {
        "a": "yeah, for that first chord it just depends how dense you wanna make it. which in this case will partially depend on what textures you have. but in general, the Abmaj7 will sound 'dreamy/longing', the Eb/Ab will sound more \"shiny\", and the Abmaj9 will of course be a hybrid of the two situations",
        "q": "I think it would make more sense to remove the Bb and keep C on the first chord and leave the 4 chords like this: https://imgur.com/mGJT4lj"

      {
        "a": "yeah, and it's important to remember we're splitting hairs here before the actors have even arrived, so to speak",
        "q": "but tbh i find it hard to decide mostly because of indecisiveness and fomo on the other possibilities."

      {
        "a": "seems totally cool to me, but no one will know until someone has read the script. i.e. knows the melody and the lyrics",
        "q": "Would those last voicings make the most sense to you?"
      },
      {
        "a": "i think in the rickroll song you'll need that dreamy C note under there and the Bb would be optional in terms of shine but most likely i think it would be Abmaj7. i'd bet on that being what they used. specifically i'd venture to wager that there is a good chance the G note was only in the vocal. (this is pending transpositions of course)",
        "q": "I really like the other 2 voicings but I'm not 100% sure of my choice of voicing it as Cmin with Ab bass (to make a Abmaj7) I was wondering to what degree would context have to change for those 3 to be usable or the most optimal for specific contextual situations in your opinion? Is my choice the most appropriate for a Rickroll reharm/voicing?"
      },
      {
        "a": "also this is a good time to mention if you haven't tried this, do this same sequence but keep the bass on Ab for your second chord also. like Bb over Ab for the second chord. this would be exactly the \"you are everything and everything is you\", i think you'll recognize this cliche tear-jerking ballad sequence, which seems to have originated in the 70s (i think?) but can be heard well throughout the 80s and 90s and even today. especially in those sappy 'i miss you dearly' sort of feels. i think you'll recognize what i mean right away",

I think its the Gmin7 with a \"Bb add9\" on top. so really a Gmin7 add11 with doubled 5th and 7th,  but revisitting it it should be a Bb something, as so the F something should really be a Ab something. and yes i do agree these are separate universes, but i wont let that excuse me from doing things in a perceivably wrong way(regardless of how thick i want my supersaws to sound). I get too sidetracked for beefiness that I may be overdoing the voicings and cluttering the arrangement (and missing the tonal center). Highly truly appreciate you taking your time to go over my rant and bring obje ctivity.   Now I have another point of view(and way more experienced) on my voicing approach or atleast cataloguing.  Sometimes it feels like im working on a vacuum but im super grateful and lucky to be able to bounce these things with a way more experienced skillster to atleast have a sense of where the needle might be pointing as opposed to letting my subjectivenes or missfocus from sidetracking me into a least-ideal place. I hope my follow up made more sense and had less mistakes at essential points. . So the 2 chord thing i was describing once i take your advice into consideration would be something like Ab bass (the F at the bottom was really unnecesary, its really some sort of Ab) with right hand doing g-bb-eb, and then going to G bass with f-g-bb-d on right hand."

        "a": "that seems great but very much on the high side. your bass notes are around middle C. this is cool, but if you are generally in the meat of the arrangement, your bass notes are going to be an octave lower (probably 2) and the right hand parts would be maybe half an octave lower. i'd say a nice happy range for your first chord (speaking in Hz again, cuz it's the only way to truly say which octaves we're using) Ab 52, and chord would start from Bb233 and up. a good range for the other one would be Bb 58, and C D F starting from middle C and up.",
        "q": "Or it's a feel-along excercise with the theory behind the played voicings being an afterthought to analyze what was done? Upon  yet ano ther revision my last version would be Ab (207.65) and on right hand g(392)-bb-c=eb which would translate to Abmaj7add9, and then for second chord Bb on bass (233) and then on right hand f(349)-bb-c-d. which would be a Bbadd9. Does it sound like a more balanced voicing?"
      },
      {
        "a": "that's always cool, if you don't know the song yet and specifically what it needs where. also it's good to practice shuffling the range around so the chord/harmony generally is situated around the middle C range. that's just where all the harmony wants to be. i think the more music you check out, the more you will find that that's almost always where the actual harmony is taking place. you may have many instruments helping out, but there are never actually that many different notes being played. the harmonic content is really usually in the middle C range and slightly above. that's just something that i've found over time. when you hear a dense arrangement with a lot of instruments, i think you'd be amazed to find out that there still aren't that many different notes being played, there will be a lot of instruments playing the same notes (layering)",
        "q": "I did have a weird keys patch where i was jamming with it but going to a normal keyboard sound makes it clearer to hear what im doing instead of letting the reverb disguise the sound.

The thing is, when moving from first set of 8 to second set of 8, the checklist becomes twice as long when trying to make the change fast, since I have to run the checklist of 2 4 note chords as opposed to a big one. So my mind is split making sure I got the left hand right and then the right hand right (and with the memorized finger positions)."

        "a": "just for some perspective, i've already mentioned that i think  you are living in a completely alternate universe from me, and that might be ok, but, generally if I see Gb7 on the page, the basic go-to way i would play this (not taking any context into account), and if i am the only instrument (not a band) i would play 1 note in the left hand and 2 notes in the right hand. Left hand is bass note Gb (let's say the 92.5hz one) and the right hand is playing Bb and E (233 and 330). depending on context and what key the song is in etc etc you might need a little more (maybe add Db in between) but that voicing would pretty much be the standard for me. If i'm in a band and there is already a bass player there, do the same thing but skip the bass note",
        "q": "So let's say I have a less than ideal memorized way of placing my fingers on the notes because that's how i first came upon them, then I would just be repeating my mistake everytime simply because thats how i memorized the 2 blocks. But on the other hand if my \"mental check list\" goes note by note from the bottom up, then my hands might fix the mistake the second time i play by going \"ah, that makes more sense how my fingers landed on the notes this time around\" and instead of memorizing how to place my hand on them, my hands start learning finger placement instinct in a sense, and i have more mental space to do/think other things. I always thought it was easier to memorize both blocks because, lets say for the second 8 note chord I could memorize Gb7"
      },
      {
        "a": "i think you are overestimating the existence of 2 handed chords. if you are using 2 hands for a chord, your hands should either be very very close (like in the same range) and hopefully not playing more than about 6 notes max (beyond that it just gets crazy dense ... if you add more notes, they should be on the same notes you're already playing. which means other instruments have to play them) OR, you have a chord with your right hand and 1 note in the bass range. but only do this if you have absolutely no other bass player in your group",
        "q": "on left hand and a Bbadd9 on the right hand, both on root position. But I am coming to the realization that seeing them this way may intelectualize the process too much and make me think  of music in more math/pattern terms rather than feeling the music. As for the puzzle part, if i just play the right notes and not worry about which hand does which, the hands slowly start gaining instinct of how to play what. And everytime you play them, you're figuring out the finger-placement puzzle again, or atleast starting to make the connection of both hands working as one as opposed to LH does x, RH does  y. Another advantage I believe is that when changes need to be made to the voicing they are made to the whole at the same time, and rebalancing voices in the other hand to fit the change becomes easier. Because you don't need to relearn both blocks again and/or how they differ from the previous version of the chord, you just need to solve a new puzzle when playing.Mentally it feels kind of like the first time I started seeing the harmonies in classical music as opposed to just learning the notes and the order they come in at. Way easier to play bach's prelude 1 if you know the chords that are being arpeggiated rather than learning/reading each note by itself as it comes. I thin I am slowly unhindering myself of the limitations of the way I learned to play music as a kid. It just always seemed so intimidating to me seeing people improv 2 handed chords"

        "a": "oh you meant Gmin7. the example i gave before was for Gb7. --- Gb7 actually means Gb dominant 7",
        "q": "over changes and I thin perhaps they weren't thining of them as 2 separate blocks one for each hand, but as one whole thing. The other advantage to not seeing it as 2 hands I believe is that it's easy to say, well that chord needs one less note, and just play the chord and let the fingers figure out who plays who, as opposed to trying to keep balance or saying \"well, there was 4 and 4, now theres 4 and 3, i should probably take one out of the left hand too to make it balanced\" when the balance perhaps doesn't lie in number of notes in each hand but simply what the music needs, which might not always makes sense in the pattern/balance-seeking frame of mind. I hope it makes more sense or atleast shows what I'm thinking better.<br/><br/>Tl;dr, \"Gb7 on left hand, Bbadd9 on right hand\" turns into G-Bb-D-F-Bb-C-D-F."
      },
      {
        "a": "i've really never memorized anything of that sort. most of the learning i've ever done with regard to keyboard / chords / fingering, etc, has been a result of spending a very very long time with the keyboard in a deep state of experimental enjoyment. also i will mention again that this default idea that both hands are supposed to play a chord seems all wrong. the only scenario really where i think that would be a good idea is if you had 2 keyboards and you were playing them right in the same range and at least some of the notes are the same. the magic range where harmony/chords work is generally very small (within about 1 octave range). when you spread out, at least on the low side, you'll want single notes only (for bass range). and if you are talking about spreading way up higher, still i think you are going to find that this \"each hand plays a chord\" idea is just not sound. at least i think that's what you find when you start really paying attention to the sound",
        "q": "First one might make more sense for writing down/analyzing, second might be more instinctive and wont rely on having to make sense of each hand as an individual chord. Like, on the example of the first chord F-Ab-C-Eb-G-Bb-Eb-G, itd be hard to categorize G-Bb-Eb-G as a recognizable chord, perhaps some sort of Eb in first inversion with a doubled 3rd on the top but I want to let my ears do the listening, my fingers the playing and my mind the enjoying instead of intelectualizing it. It may seem I'm saying the newer way im doing it is better but I think maybe it just complements something that's been lacking in my approach to music thus far and a balance must be found as opposed to committing to one way or the other. I find the mind of a piano harmony improvizer intriguing and I hope this new approach makes it less convoluted in my head. It just seems like itll be way easier to improvize when im not trying to first make two independent hand voicings and placing them together as opposed to thining of a big voicing spread through all my fingers (and let them do the chosing of which plays what note as opposed to summoning up some finger positions from the catalogue since my catalogue may be too limited atm. It feels like when playing with this new frame of mind, it's easier to try new stuff and let the music speak to me. How do you approach memorizing/improvizing voicings when you are writing/arranging/playing?"

Of the tasks that need to be accomplished to finish this thing, I (at this moment) only have the skills necessary to complete about 20% of it. Due to advice received from other people, I've spent the last 4 months trying to work with other people who have the other 80% of the skills I need and as a result, I feel like I have wasted the last 4 months of time I could have spent working because I'm no further along in the process than I was before. Each time I find another human who I think can contribute, I end up moving backwards. <br/><br/>I think this is because of a few things. 1) they're only focused on what they will get out of it monetarily (which is fair and also achievable with this thing I have begun to create, but their focus on money rewards doesn't accomplish anything). 2) they wait for me to spoon feed the creative process into their brains to fill i n incomp lete holes in the vision instead of trying things themselves. 3) If they do make anything, they protect all parts of it instead of submitting to the creative editing and improvement process.<br/><br/>The world is telling me that at some point I will just find these people and that if I keep asking everyone I meet for help on the project, I will eventually finish the thing.<br/><br/>BUT. I'm really starting to think that this isn't true and that what the OG creator is telling me is that I need to do this alone. I need to spend the time teaching myself to do the other 80% and then just do it.<br/><br/>Now I'm wandering my house feeling angry that this is something I have to do by myself. I really like other humans and it's hard for me to believe that I alone can make something as incredible in real life as what I'm seeing and hearing in my head. <br/><br/>Because this is going to take a really long time. And I'm already lonely. But I gotta do it. And I'm crying. Cause  I'm scar ed. And it's so much work. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Is the next step to teach myself all those other skills? And then once I have an approximate idea of how to use the tools, I start making whatever the best version of the thing I can. And then I start showing it to people? Is that right?<br/>"

        "a": "what really made my head explode upon a closer listen, there's 2 things actually. when the bass hits the F, F#, G, A thing, that's like the most cliche figure in the world and it's been in 1000s of songs (especially american 'jazz' popular sort of songs from the 1930s and 40s i suppose?) (and also many nintendo games) and the chords are F, Fdim, C/G, A7. it really blew my mind to hear that the A note on the Fdim chord actually had F natural harmonized under it. that was the worst offender. it just HAS to be F#. now, it's easy for me to sit here and complain, but i must admit, from experience, in some cases you may go in and make it what you think it's supposed to be and it just doesn't work. Sometimes you see these paradoxes where the bass will do it the twisty way and the melody will just completely ignore the twists and do it straight, and for some reason it just works fine that way when you breeze through it. it's one of the great mysteries of life. The other issue, which was a little bit less disturbing but yet still defied all norms of the 'genre', is the A7, which in every fiber of instinct feels like it was supposed to be A7, and the harmony note should have been C#, but in reality they used C. this is not nearly as big a 'crime' as the F and A notes over the F# bass, but yet still common sense and experience of the 'genre' still begs that to be A7, at that point in the song. It really makes you want to wonder if there is some technoligical restriction at play, preventing us from having any melody or harmony notes outside the plain C major scale set. but this is disproved if we take a look at the other section, on the D7 chord, we have F#s right in there. The only other thing i MIGHT be inclined to hypothesize is that the melody and harmony line were written and programmed before the bass was there? and it was planned to be less 'jazz' and more 1, 4, 5 triads. then when the bass came along there was somehow a decision to go more 'jazz' and yet the harmony was not changed to match the bass. This is unlikely and doesn't match nintendo's reputation for perfection especially in these types of genres, they usually absolutely nail this stuff. or again to restate my other theory it could simply be that upon trying the 'correct' 'twisty' harmonies there you would expect, it might have just not sounded right. one of the great mysteries of the universe, but sometimes that is the case. BUT, without constructing a sound-alike and testing for myself, my current hypothesis is that it does weaken the song at those moments to have the notes in there the way they currently are, and i do believe it would be stronger if those were sharped. but i am only about 85-90% sure, short of actually constructing a sound-alike and trying it at tempo and in context",
