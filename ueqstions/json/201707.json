I just can't help but feel that an experts opinion even on art is more important than an average consumers opinion. Your thoughts?"

I have about 10 years of piano lessons behind me, but I still can't seem to \"just make stuff up\" I don't understand how some people can just listen to a tune and improvise something that sounds incredible off of it. I know some music theory so I can do very simple harmony beneath a melody that I've heard, but I don't know how to make it sound good or jazzy. When I try to mess around on the piano I always revert back to trying to follow the rules I've been taught but failing to turn it into an effective song. Do you have any ideas or tips for how I might be able to improvise more effectively and learn how to harmonize in ways that sound good and rich to me and others?"

    "q": [
      {
        "a": "since it's already odd and doesn't have 5,  check for 3. the check for 3 is if the digits add up to another multiple of 3. you can also do this by knocking off all multiples of 3 you see in the digits, even if it's multiple digits next to each other. so delete the 9s, delete the 3, and delete the \"42\". and you're left with 2 which is not a multiple of 3 so we've ruled out 3. Now you just start moving through the prime numbers, checking each one. there are many different tricks here, but it's generally the same strategies for every other prime from now on. let's say we're checking for 7 (the next prime to check for). see the 23, on the left? that's close to 21, so let's change that to 2.  == 29429. what this means is, we just subtracted 210000 from the original number. so what this means is, if the original number is a multiple of 7, then 2949 has to be a multiple of 7 also because we just subtracted 210000 (which is clearly a multiple of 7).  basically we manipulate the original number by multiples of 7, until it is simple enough to see whether the resulting number is a multiple of 7. and if it is, congratulations the original number was a multiple of 7 also. in the manipulations, you are allowed to add or subtract any multiple of 7, and you can also multiply or divide by anything you want. so from 29429, i can see \"42\" in there, so you can just replace that with zero 29009 (we just subtracted 420, which of course is a multiple of 7).  now let's add 21 == 29030, knock off the zero at the end (you can divide this by 10 and it won't effect whether or not it's a mutiple of 7, so you can knock off zeros on the end all you want.) so 2903. now let's add 7 == 2910, knock off the zero = 291.  (you can see the strategy, we're adding/subtracting small multiples of 7 based on whatever can even off the end to have a zero at the end, because then we can kill the zero and the number shrinks and still has its same status with regard to being a multiple of 7 or not.)  so from 291, take off 21 is 270, knock off the zero is 27. which is clearly NOT a multiple of 7. basically i'm adding and subtracting multiples of seven to get the number simpler and simpler until eventually we can tell if the resulting number is a multiple of 7.   and if you couldn't see whether 27 was a multiple of 7 then you could just knock off the 7 and it's 20, knock off the zero is 2. which is not a multple of 7. So congratulations, the original number (239429) is not a multiple of 7. Next we check for 11s. i would start with the left again, because 23 is so close to 22. replace it with 1 == 19429. then add 11 to the right,(and kill the zero) 1944. you can knock off 44, and pow, 19, not 11. so 11 is ruled out. Then start again for 13.  from the left, change the 23 to 10 (effectively subtracting 130000), == 109429. '109' is 5 above 104 which i happen to know has 13 in it, so replace 109 with 5. == 5429.  54 is 2 above 52, which i happen to know has 13 in it, so 229. what's the nearest multiple of 13 above 229? 260. is that a multiple of 13 away? can't be because the only one in that century with 1 at the end of it is 91 and it's not 91 away (it's 31 away, again non-13.) so 13 is out. now check for 17. repeat this process through the primes, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, etc etc.  and you may be wondering \"how far do i have to go before knowing if the original number is prime.\" well the answer is, if you are checking them all in order and you do it correctly, the process is guaranteed complete once you reach the square root of the original number. the way to loosely figure that out is, look at 250000. square root of that should be 5 with zeros ...500 times 500 should be 250000. so in this case if you check all the primes up to 500 and you don't find a match then you know you can stop. but if you find a match at let's say 31, then you divide the thing by 31 and then you have a much smaller number to work with, and find the primes there. then when you're done just include 31 as well. by the way i didn't check 31 in this example so 31 probably is not in there",
        "q": "you replied to a question: \"i can find the prime factorization of 6 digit numbers in my head\" do you have a trick to do this? how would I find the prime factorization of 239429 in my head?"

I think you should switch to the pro X version because the magnetic time alone will save you a ton of time on your videos (you can also disable it when need be). I think you will also be able to transfer your current graphics to the new version of final cut. All this should enable you to finish something like the Japan video in 1 month. Although it may seem uncomfortable I believe that it is an absolute necessary step if you want to continue making longer videos within a reasonable amount of time. I am not an editing expert so I cannot offer you a tutorial. But if the tutorials on youtube don't help I'm sure one of your fans would be willing to help you over email on a step by step basis if you like. Would you be willing to consider it?"

What chord comes before it, what comes after? What notes are the other instruments/singer playing at the same time you're playing your chord (the bass player has the power to change a lot of chords if he/she wants to and the \"melody instrument\" can add extensions). It doesn't really matter what name you give the chord, but if you're writing a piece of sheet music or something.. I'd give it the name that I think makes the most sense in the full context of the song."

But, you might find somebody who has their own vision, unique from yours, that inspires or interests you in some way...  then you can combine visions to make a super-vision. Like when the Power Rangers link up all their giant robots together to make a mega giant robot and together they defeat some intergalactic monster sent by Lord Zedd... that's what collaboration is. You don't have to compromise your own ideas and direction."

And then, at another time, in another suit, at another desk, as a different employee, you will get down to work in a nice, quiet place. Which idea the 'worker' chooses to work on will have nothing to do with which idea was created first, or last, or anything else. There will need to be another decision system that chooses which idea to do when. and i don't know what the best way is, that is something you will have to manage within the company as a whole. but if all else fails, computer aided random number selection does work. So actually there is 3 job titles. the dreamer (idea creator) the worker (who works on the idea) and the manager, who SOMEHOW has to decide what idea to work on. i think it is very important that the worker and the manager do not play the same role at the same time-- the worker needs to never question the authority of the decision to work on the project at hand, or else they will not be able to focus on making that project the best it can be. the manager needs to make that decision, and then tell the worker what the project is.",

        "q": "<br/>Analysis:<br/><br/><br/>Part 1: play by play<br/><br/>The video opens up with our protagonist \"Steve\" introducing himself. The very next thing he tells us is that he drives a car thats stuck in a tree. He then goes on to admit he was lying and that his real name isn't steve. he then says that he's filing for an extension on his taxes because he didn't pay them but in the same sentence says doesn't plan to do them. Why? Because \"thats the way he likes to live his life and he feels like everything's gonna be fine\". The day ends. The next day he tells the viewer that hes skipping work again, implying he does it frequently, but clarifies that its because hes unemployed. The mailman delivers mail but he adds the details that he was late and wa s actual ly a woman. She then breaks into the same jingle steve did earlier saying \"thats the way i like to live my life...\" . All of a sudden theres a change of scenery and he starts talking about mountains that we can see are right behind his house yet he says \"I don't remember why i first saw the mountains\". He then says that they've ALWAYS been there. He wonders why they're there but whether he knows or not he has to accept that they're there. He says that he can't claim them. Then he does a complete 180 and states that he can and does so very quickly. He then starts the jingle from before. \"Thats the way i like to live my life..\" but he gets cut off right as he starts, its another mail delivery. This time the person delivering it is a bird but he doesn't mention anything about it nor does he mention anything about the mail being delivered straight to him rather then to his house. The mailman doesn't break into a jingle this time, only saying \"heres the mail.\" The letter is adres sed to s teve despite that not being his name, which he points out, and it asks how he climbed the mountain. Steve says he glad the person asked and gives a simple answer saying that its a simple two step process, first find the mountain, then climb it. After this steve breaks into the last jingle of the video but this time he says \"Thats the way we can get things done and thats how I do it, its easy and simple cause you know what to do.\" Steve stands there smiling when a downpour starts but steve doesn't react at all simply standing there and smiling. A 5 day weather forecast pops up on screen showing nothing but rain for each day and it moves rapidly showing rain for many more days then 5. Steve then says \"bye i'm steve\" despite saying it wasn't his name earlier and the screen cuts to black.<br/><br/><br/>Part 2: Breakdown of Steve<br/><br/>This is obviously a very confusing story. The main character \"steve\" makes many contradictory and strange statements and bizarre things ha ppen wit h no explanation. To fully understand this we need to look at the story part by part then look at the big picture. First of all why does steve introduce himself as steve and then say thats not actually his name? The character steve seems to represent many things throughout the story, at times he operates the same as any normal person, or character in a story might but at other times he does very strange things. He changes his identity and says things that are impossible such as him driving a car in a tree, theres also a point where a talking bird delivers him mail. Steve doesn't pay taxes and doesn't have a job, He's also secluded from others in the mountains. These traits are indicative of multiple personality disorder and schizophrenia. The viewer isn't a character in the story but he talks to the viewer, rather then just narrating whats happening I think steve is talking to himself and the viewer is seeing whats happening through his eyes, this is why we saw the bird talk ing. The  first real thing does in the story is file for an extension on his tax returns and then say he wont ever be paying them. Although this statement may seem like he doesn't plan to pay what he owes, I think whats actually happening is steve doesn't owe anything at all. Steve doesn't appear to live in a city but rather a rural area with mountains so it may be either he is excused from paying taxes because of his mental ailments or the government of his country doesn't require its citizens to pay taxes.<br/><br/><br/>Part 3: breakdown of events<br/><br/>First, Either way the point of him filing for an extension is pointless,"
      },

        "a": "this is almost an identical strategy to the taxes line. i'm skipping work again today (which seemed neat because it implies that you skip work a lot, so shouldn't you have been fired by now?) but adding \"because i don't have a job\" i just thought was a nice twist.",

        "q": "and his mental afflictions may prevent him from growing or working towards something meaningful. His random bursts into jingles show how childlike his mental state is and the flashing colors show his warped views of reality."

        "q": "and this is when he starts to say something rational although pointless and unneeded."
      },
      {
        "a": "the point of the 'woman' line is, again, we're adding a twist to the end of the line. like the end of the taxes line, or the end of the skipping work line. the idea of a mailman who is a woman seems fun to me because the word 'mailman' sounds like it's a man. but it's actually a woman. and i just thought it was an interesting place to reveal someone's gender.",
        "q": "He says the mailman was actually a woman and was late, despite this statement being unneeded it makes sense and theres no indication of it being false."
      },
      {
        "a": "right. i figured it was a nice time to go back into that jingle, because it is almost sooner than you would expect, but it is familiar, so things don't get too crazy just yet. and the twist here is, it almost sounds as though she's singing about her gender, almost as if she chose to be that gender. i figured this was probably a nice touch, because gender freedom is something that i think we've all been thinking about more and more these days. but again it's not totally clear why she is singing it. it is left slightly up in the air, which again i think is a nice strategy especially for a video like this where you are never quite sure what the heck is going on.",

        "a": "no one really knows why paper mail carriers are there anymore. nowadays we mostly use email for everything. which is another reason why 'mailman' seems like a fun idea. everyone knows what it is, and it seems familiar, yet in the back of your mind, what are they really doing? it's just a person who visits your house every day. which seems nice",
        "q": "She also doesn't identify herself as a mailman but steve does, maybe its because she did deliver something to steve without him realizing."

      },
      {
        "a": "the point of the mountains is to add a new larger twist to the feel of the video. we've already gone through some 'daily' sounding sort of riff raff (cars, names, mail, paperwork, etc.) and we've also seen the same jingle twice, so it almost feels like we're in a pattern. so time for something bigger, different, at a different pace. the mountains scene is at a much slower pace, much more of an ominous, deep feeling.",

        "a": "this part was fun, because it was an excuse to bring back the name ambiguity. obviously the letter should say 'dear steve' because you naturally think this guy's name is steve, because the video is called 'hi i'm steve' with him in the picture, and the first thing that happens in the video is you see the guy tell you his name is steve. so honestly even i forgot his name wasn't steve, until i said it (\"dear steve\") and then i instantly realized the fun built-in opportunity to reference the name ambiguity here, which sort of anchors that as a recurring theme. also gives steve a chance to mug to the camera which i thought was neat. was very careful on the facial expression here so as to not seem too mad nor too happy. just kind of shrugging it off.",

        "a": "i think the more important part of this section is the part just before he gives the explanation. he looks in the air for a minute, and i feel like we're really not sure what tone this video is going to take. honestly the \"well i'm glad you asked that\" is something that's been lingering in my head for a long time, there is a music video for a 1988 song called 'da butt', and in the intro to the video, spike lee is interviewed and he answers the question starting just like that 'well i'm glad you asked that' in a very similar tone and i just thought it was great. so that type of tone on that line has been stuck in my head for a while now. and as for the 2 step program, i think a detailed setup with bluntly simple contents is always a nice device i think, i have done it in a lot of my videos, and i have always fallen in love with it seeing it other places. (there is a tweet somewhere, not mine, that says \"parts of the worm\" and listed underneath it just says \"worm.\") it's just a fun device, set things up formally and yet have the contents be way more simple than you expected it. And, getting metaphorical about the mountains, let's say it does represent challenges and obstacles (which i think it does) sometimes there is really no good explanation for solving them. you just do it. but actually now that i think about it, this 2 step program is very important because a lot of people miss the first step. identifying the problem is so incredibly important and solving it actually gets surprisingly easier when you just identify the problem! so actually i wholeheartedly believe in that explanation.",
