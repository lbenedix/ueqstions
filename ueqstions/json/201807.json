        "a": "what i've developed is a hybrid system between sheer number randomization and actually choosing. actually choosing can be impossible, especially if you are terrified of picking the wrong one. sheer randomization works on the idea that there could not possibly be any right or wrong one and it doesn't matter. the hybrid system goes like this: make preliminary exclusions for various reasons, and then randomize amongst the finalists. Start by listing all the items. go through them all, and it is very important that you fully and truly check out every one, go find the source material, find your notes, find the demos, whatever you have, but don't just go based on the title or memory. at least half the time the song turns out better than you remember it, if you actually go and listen to it. then start excluding ones you absolutely know should not be picked, and it should be only for very specific reasons. usually these reasons would be in direct relation to the most recent song(s) i released. for example, last year i released a song called california, then a song called i love you. when choosing for the next song, a song called \"california love\" might be a bad choice. other common exclusion reasons are if the tempo or groove is too similar to the previous song. So i go through the entire list and make exclusions. which should be minimal but recently i've become extremely particular and exclude almost everything, which is getting back to the original problem with manual 'conscious' picking (and the problem is \"being a chicken\"). i would be discouraged by this, but, the good news is, every time there are at least a few songs that absolutely jump out at me and scream yes. so i guess this is ok but one thing that complicates this system is that more complete (written) songs tend to be more obvious choices. where as songs which only have 1 line written tend to not be as strong a contender as perhaps they should be. especially because i would get to write the majority of it brand new if it were picked, likely enabling it to be an even stronger pick. randomization boosts those small bits' chances of being picked, but doing pre-elimination often wipes out many of those. this also brings up an interesting point about doing this ONLY with finished (written) songs, vs including all fragments. in the past 2 years i've done it where i include all fragments, because the fragments are usually newer, and stronger, (newer because they would be less likely to have been finished yet, and stronger because they are newer, and even stronger because i get to finish them in the present time). but the drawback for including bits is like i said they often have trouble competing with more complete ones. so for this reason it is important to be extra specific in your exclusion reasons, vividly explaining to yourself the reason. (too similar to last song, etc.). and \"too unwritten yet\" is not a valid excuse, and that's almost a great reason to keep it. this is why randomization helps, because it will boost the chances for those bits which were too small to demand being picked, but yet not excludable for any specific reason. which essentially allows you to write a mostly entirely new song, and make it good on demand, because it's already been selected as the next one to record.<br/>so once you have it down to finalists, sometimes i go through again because i am usually so darn scared to pick the wrong one, probably because to fully produce a song and an entire video by yourself with rising standards takes a very long time so i am very scared to be stuck with the wrong one. so sometimes i go through the list and comb it down again, but it's probably bad to do that too much because you end up wiping out all the tiny fragments. finally when you have maybe 20-40 finalists, then just a simple random number selection (from random.org, for example) will pick for you, and if you did your exclusions properly you will hopefully never run into a wrong pick ('really?? another marijuana song?')",
        "q": "you mentioned a couple times that you have made decisions about what to do next based on some kind of \"tournament\" format.  do you have any tips for how to do this effectively or things you've learned from doing it.  like, what rules do you make the decisions follow, what will get them disqualified for cheating and so forth.  I might be doing this soon"

Hip hop and rap and pop aren't music... etc etc etc\" And this guy's so happy that he met someone (me) who he can \"nerd out\" with and gush about all of his favorite music and stuff.... But, how can I tell this guy that just because I like some of that \"classic rock\" stuff, doesn't mean that I don't also like the music I hear on the radio today, and (even though I don't like genres) most of the music in listen to probably wouldn't be called \"rock\" by most people. I feel I've reached the point of no return and it's too late for me to admit that I like a lot of the music he loves hating on. I'm fine talking about the bands we both like, but I get really uncomfortable when the conversation turns to bash ing mode rn artists and non-rock music. And he always tries to rope me into talking about hating music that's not rock music from the 60s and 70s."

        "a": "this might take patience. it is like a doctor's diagnosis, you are the doctor. and you need to figure out how to take care of this piece. this task can be confusing and requires patience, but it can be done. it's usually just a long game of \"what do we know\" and asking many questions and eventually you will figure out what the solution is. if you test things categorically you can eliminate things instantly and narrow it down pretty swiftly. there are many questions you could ask, but i will try to list some of the questions that i usually ask. 1. does it seem to want to stay in the same form (same chords, same form, etc. same thing) for the 'other section.' some songs absolutely need that, and some songs are absolutely allergic to it. just doing a simple test and listen to whether it makes you extremely happy or uncomfortable, should be pretty easy to answer that one. another thing you might look at is lyrical content. another important tip, i heard a rumor that dave grohl gave this advice once, and the advice is called \"get to the chorus\"... like don't waste any freakin time if you don't have to. here's an interesting thing to check for: could you actually start with the chorus. in some cases this is just right, in some cases it's all wrong. a simple test should prove that one way or the other. here's a neat trick, do a regular run-thru of the chorus and figure out what wants to go Next. if that works then you could get your 'other section' from there. then you would be on to a different question which is which goes first and how. another strategy which is similar to one of the ones i already said, remember that the point of this whole thing is the part that you know already. the part that exists (the chorus, in this case). so just focus on that. that's the point of this whole thing. so maybe even start bargaining for that to be really the only part of the song in the entire song. and then just see how wrong that is and make adjustments from there. here's another thing to check for, starting with the chorus and then do another chorus with different lyrics, etc. i'm sure you've heard a million songs that are like that.  that's often just the ticket if you have a strong chorus that seems to be the star of the show. those are just some things to check for, over all this is going to be a puzzle but if you are gentle with it the answer will arrive. if the part you already wrote is great then it is guaranteed that there is a solution. also i almost forgot to mention, if you come up with extraneous things that are good but don't fit, always log those (separately)",
