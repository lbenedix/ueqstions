        "q": "Like, M3m3 would be a major chord expressed by a major third followed by a minor third. But in first inversion itd be m3P4, a minor third with a perfect fourth after it. Kind of what the idea is with roman numeral inversions, having I be root, I6 be first inversion (with implied third as middle voice, and the 6th being the top voice interval with bass note), and I64 for second inversion, (6th and 4th intervals from bass). Except this system ive been trying to figure out would show the relationship between each note to their closest note up and down. Ideally itd show all relationships, But I think intervals as a unit make sense trying to categorize chords not only by what notes are being played, but their inversions. Sometimes it feels like this way \"harmony\" or \"notation\" would make more sense. Best way I can think of it is a stack of geometry upwards like a totem, or stacked figures using the same center (with their corners touching the same imaginary circle).<br/><br/>Do you have a specific way you visualize/categorize relationships in music"

Do you have any tips for breaking as many walls as you can daily? Things we may never know we could learn unless we tried doing them.

These facts include biological facts about height, weight, race, gender, skin color, eye color, etc. However, these facts also include social and economic, psychological and historical facts as well. Transcendence is the first person perspective of a human being. With transcendence, human beings can \"transcend\" their facticity and become something more than they are or seem to be. This \"something\" they can become is a result of that human beings individual choices or decisions, and many turn it in to a tug-a-war situation in life. People who want both 100% of transcendence and facticity basically want to be god is some sort, \"can do no wrong but has ultimate power\". So my question is what is your take on this, is there a possible balance you choose when it comes between the two?"

There are many many ambiguous cases, especially when you can't decide whehter to take the \"ionian perspective\" or the relative minor (\"aeolian perspective\", as you might say). Like a song that is firmly in A minor in the verse, then does F C G G for the chorus, obviously the chorus is in C. Or the ever so popular perpetually looping Amin F C G sequence, that's the most famously ambiguous case. The whole thing sounds like it's in C except that the first chord is actually Amin. Some songs are ambiguous as to which way you'd call it, but the melody is really what holds the answers",

Someone in the comments said no, it's clearly in Ab major and goes ii &gt; vi &gt; V &gt; IV. Someone else said no, it's in F minor and goes iv &gt; i &gt; VII &gt; VI. It was all a bit silly and it made me wonder if I should just analyze all songs in a major key even if they're minor or another mode. E.g. it seems a lot easier to just remember that vi &gt; IV sounds cool rather than remembering both vi &gt; IV and i &gt; VI since they are the same notes. Do you see any downsides in only thinking about chords from an \"ionian perspective\"? (this might be a cool math rock band name) Or are there benefits in calling the vi chord the i chord if the song is in a minor key?"

        "q": "I personally hate astrology, but I have a couple of friends/acquaintances/family members who are into it and from what I can tell, the attraction of astrology isn't that it can predict the future. 99% of astrology fans don't know if Mercury is in retrograde or what that even means. They couldn't identify a single one of the zodiac constellations in the actual night sky.<br/><br/>The attraction of astrology is that it's an elaborate personality test that encourages a lot of self-reflective navel-gazing, which some people enjoy and find beneficial. For instance, the \"typical\" positive Aries traits are courage, daring and competitiveness, while the negative traits are self-centeredness, anger and pushiness. Obviously, not every person born in the month of April has these as their dominant traits... but pretty much everyone has these traits present to some extent, so they'll reflect on this crude psychological assessment. An Aries who actually is dari ng and c ompetitive might acknowledge that they come off as rude or attention-seeking to others. And an Aries who's naturally shy might feel empowered by a personality test that tells them that deep down, they're courageous and decisive. Astrology books that promise to give relationship tips for Capricorns and Libras (or whatever) are actually just full of basic good communication advice that will probably smooth a relationship between any two people. So people can feel like they're getting real benefit from astrology.<br/><br/>If people really don't feel like their personality fits their sign, they can get a fancy natal chart done that will tell them that even though their sign in Taurus, the position of Jupiter or whatever counteracts their Taurus traits and makes them a true Scorpio. Astrology is just a very elaborate, mystical personality test that you can manipulate to get whatever results you want. It's really not that different from the MBTI personality test, which is extrem ely popu lar among \"rational\" people even though it's junk science. People like personality tests and astrology because people like thinking about themselves and coming up with fancy terms to express their identity.<br/>"
