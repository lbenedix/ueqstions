Remember to remain open to all possibilities! including nothing. this part of songwriting is something i call \"finishing\" because there is really no telling what it's going to need. every song is different. i've heard so many songs that in my opinion fail at 'finishing' because they didn't take proper care to figure out what's best for that song. in other words, having a bridge when there shouldn't be a bridge. having the wrong kind of bridge. bridges are unpredictable anyway and this ties in with the 'be open to anything' strategy. this is a very sensitive part of the process, and every song needs something distinctly different, and quite possibly nothing. you will only know clearly after doing a full run through, and start paying attention about halfway through second chorus. many times your next step will be something that almost interrupts the end of the chorus to go to a different thing. other examples of things that work in some songs are: another verse with no lyrics. another chorus with no lyrics. maybe a totally different thing with no lyrics. another chorus with different lyrics. a totally different thing with lyrics. but this is a sensitive issue and every song has very distinctive needs, so you need to make sure you are doing full run throughs and really let the song decide what it needs or doesn't need.",

You are standing some distance off in the train yard, next to a lever. If you pull this lever, the trolley will switch to a different set of tracks. However, you notice that there is one person on the side track. You have two options: (1) Do nothing, and the trolley kills the five people on the main track. (2) Pull the lever, diverting the trolley onto the side track where it will kill one person. Which is the correct choice?"

Also, another twist i just thought of -- a lot of songs do like a 2-5 and then another 2-5 a whole step lower -- so it actually kind of has that same effect when it hits the 2 of the second 2-5-- sounds like the b7min7. example of that would be c'est la vie by robbie neville. 'love' by musiq does another one chromatically in the verse, but the melody doesn't obey it as well as the 'mya' example.  here's one that may seem subtle -- there was a mariah carey song (maybe 2006??) called 'shake it off\" it's really just 3 chord hits, but it implies the same thing. t-pain 'show you how' also uses it pretty quick. also 'luv' by janet jackson uses it very expertly, with a gold-plated tritone substitution thing for the inbetween chord. basically all these are the b7min7 (to usually set up the b6) from a minor key. hope that's what you meant, i'm just taking that as the main common thread between your examples. ultimately this is a good technique, which i bet not many people know nowadays, and it is surely a great way to get chicks",
