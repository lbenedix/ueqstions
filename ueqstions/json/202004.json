Ive actually found that recording podcast has helped me have better conversations overall. Reminded me of you, by recording what you do, you probably start doing it outside of recording too in automatic. I am starting to have good-content quality conversations. I am just anxious about recording an episode with someone and having to tell them it doesnt fit my format and wont be released. (which ive done several times). its just easier to make that decision when its a just-me episode. I dont want people to make conclusions on their own capabilities as a guest if i decide its not on-format."

If your software actually cannot do keyframes (which i think it can), i'm sure there is some other very basic and simple software that is within your budget that can",

And my goal was to make a video of just a black line moving horizontally across a white background. I used MS Paint, drew a line. Took a screen shot and saved it. Moved the line the tiniest smidge forward. Took another screen shot and saved it etc etc etc. Tried stringing all the screen shots together in MovieMaker for the final product. Well, it took me an ungodly amount of time to do this. I had to make and save approximately 1 zillion screen shots. And the final product was trash. It just looked like a choppy slideshow of a bunch of pictures of a line. No fluid motion (which was my goal). I don't know what to try now. I'm super frustrated and disheartened. My plan was to learn how to just make simple shapes moving across across a blank background and then gradually move forward towards more complex motion and m ore deta iled characters/backgrounds... But I can't even get a damn line to move across the screen with fluid motion. I know I'm not exactly using state of the art technology here but if I can't figure out how to do something extremely simple on an extremely simple program, investing in some fancy animation software probably isn't the smartest move... sorry for ranting at you, bill.

If you listen to the track, this may seem surprising; the music isn't what one might associate with such tragedy. People in the comment section are grappling as to whether or not this is 'sad' music, and trying to comprehend what a confusing feeling it is to listen. There is some consensus that this really just 'neutral' music, meant to convey the idea that death is neutral. This is how I myself understand it.<br/>There is one individual however, who is dead insistent and a bit aggressive that this is JOYOUS music simply because music theory says so. Major key == happy. Case closed. The fact that one is reminded of something separate should not be considered...<br/>This blunt use of music theory stresses me out a bit. Is that somewhat true? Or not?"

(I'm not wrong, CHECK any of those pages and see for yourself. billwurtz.com/reality for example) So that means you have at least once been awake in all those hours, and thus all hours (and most presumably minutes) of the day AND night. I know you sleep, because sleep is important (and multiple people already asked if you sleep), but my conclusion after seeing all these hours of the day AND night was: sometimes you sleep in the daytime, and sometimes you sleep at night, ANY hour, you name it, you have at least once been both awake and asleep (not on the same day) in that hour."

I know you're likely going to answer this with some sort of \"holy fishpaste the magnitude of friendliness is overwhelming\" and that's great I really like those answers and how they're always different but I hope you do read this and understand the sincerity of my thanks. I have always felt like there was this slight pretentiousness living inside me about the music that I like. Like if it didn't have extended harmony or weird changes or complicated rhythms it was stupid, but only SOMEWHAT. And I never really liked this about myself but it always felt true and I had a hard time liking other, lets just say more popular sounding music. But listening to your music has made a huge change within me. Like I would never have been into a song like New Canaan even a year ago but now here I am hearing the music and enjoying it and experiencing it like how music should be experienced! And I just feel so much more open to the worl d when i t comes to writing my songs and all the opportunities that are out there. I think I'm really just enjoying music the most I ever have right now, and I owe it all to you. It definitely has an impact on how I view the world as well. Everything seems better. So thank you Bill!!!"

Actually, what i would really recommend is, after doing the drums first, send it to the chordal instruments, then send it to vocals, then send it to bass, then send it back to the drummer with drums muted and a very strong click (oh i forgot to mention you absolutely must have the click in there from the start), then send it back to the chordal instrument(s) and have them re-do that, with the new drums included, then maybe send it to bass to have that redone, then back to vocals, keep going around like this and have the people re-do their parts each time, because each time it gets closer and closer to creating the illusion of people actually playing together, because now they are hearing each other... even better, they are hearing each other do what they did while hearing each other. but i just realized you probably already knew all this. but as far as acoustics, just remember that some people spend millions of dollars on ways to try to deliberately simulate bad acoustics. hope that helps",

In a 3D environment such as history of the world, this is done with video files. render the globe moving as you want, with the full map on it, then replace the globe map with a same sized map with only the desired territory, and the rest black. re-render the exact same sequence, with exactly the same start and end time. then import both videos into your 2D timeline, and stack them, and key out the black, as before",

        "q": "Ok I think I figured it out, like why you are taking so long. Basically whenever I do anything, I feel like I have to understand it perfectly, and not just like perfectionism but like a need to see how it all works from scratch. Like I'm making a computer translator, and basically I need medium to reflect semantics. But then I get so stuck on how semantics works and I still haven't continued coding cause I'm trying to understand the underlyingness of how things work. Or like if I have to do math work, I think of the nature of numbers, how almost all operations are defined recursively in the end including addition and all, and I don't get anything done for a long time. (I'm not trying to call myself smart; I really am a lazy dumbass in the end) But in the end it's good though and not a complete waste of time, cause it feels like you get it all even if countless people have thought of the same stuff before you. And also in the end this is practic al in so me way, as actually understanding is like building foundations for a house rather than being quick to build some that that you're not sure how it stays up. Even if the people who build without foundations are more efficient really. So my guess is that as you do these 3D stuffs, you're trying to understand the stuff cause glossing over it or trusting other's people's things without understanding them just that just feels wrong. I hope I don't sound like a psychologist or something assigning a guess, I'm really just guessing a guess."

But, there's also a secondary piece of software that i've been using in addition, ever since about 2016, to do some of the 3D elements, and sometime last year when starting on a music video i just felt deep inside that i wanted to try starting off the entire video from the 3D program, just to see what happens. i've always known 3D is a nightmare mindfuck timesink, but something must have clicked in my biological timeclock or something, and i realized it was my destiny to just jump into it, and apply all the same principles of brutal simplicity that had allowed me first enter the video making realm (an equally impossible mindfuck, back then, having had no experience). So i fell hopelessly in love with this new realm, despite some of the unthinkable challenges, and then it occured to me that this is obviously the time when i am supposed to make the jump to a new system. there is literally every reason to do it, and equally many reasons 'not' to 'not' do it. it's kind of like going through puberty. your body says it's time to change and the change happens. and let's just say that the transition has set into motion so many more ridiculous and exciting developments than i had ever could have expected, and yet needed so desperetly all along. it's like when a tree grows for 10 years under a small shelf and then the shelf breaks and the tree suddenly explodes in an upward direction. could be awkward at first but you know it's gotta happen. if you've known me, you'll know i've been through this many times before",
