(1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, etc). listen to some songs and find the beat like you did before, but instead of counting them all the same, see if you can count them in groups of 4, and see if you can easily find where the \"1\" is. these groups of 4 are called Measures (or more commonly called \"Bars\"). every 4 beats (1, 2, 3, 4) makes up a bar. a bar is a unit of time which is 4 beats long. Most songs use 4 beats per bar. some songs use 3 (or even other numbers in rare cases) but usually 4. See if you can find the beats and bars in some of your favorite songs. then the next step is to get some staff paper and i will tell you how rhythms work. actually you can do rhythms without staff paper but if you want to learn to read you are going to eventually have to get staff paper. ok let me know when you are ready for the next step",

Upon the first viewing of that website, a screen is shown that says \"what's the password\". I, as well as many others who are like me, click on the button that says \" I don't know\" I am seeking the password, as I am very interested in what may lie beyond that wall. I believe that the world will be a better, more loving place if you would disclose this to the public.

Everything after graphics (score, jingles, narration, labels, troubleshoot, etc etc) for history of japan took a total of 30 days. so even if i finish graphics by thursday (wildly impossible) i would have to complete what was 30 days (for a 9 min vid) in 13 days (for a 19 min vid.) so basically that would require more than a 4x speed improvement from what i was doing in dec/jan last year on japan. but, graphics so far has generally been running at 2x speed from last year. i don't know how that's possible. maybe because i'm not trying to make vines every day? not really sure how to account for it, but i guess i have more experience now",
