<item> <dco>11.15.18  4:57 pm</dco>  <qco> Hey sorry about my message a couple hours ago saying you're in a major key rut you and should start on the one chord less and whatever, I don't really even believe that and I'm just in a very frustrated depressed bullshitty kinda phase of my life right now and I've been not writing to you much because I just don't want to spew any of that negativity at you of all people, you truly inspire me but i'm also quite jealous of you in some ways and intimidated by your skills, i guess i try to bring you down a peg in my mind sometimes so I feel better about my own abilities and achievements (or lack thereof), sorry about that, I'm trying to do better, oh and also I realized slow down's  verse starts with like an Fsus or something not a regular major anyways I think, I don't even fucking know I'm kinda stupid and anyways I'm gonna take a break from writing in till I have something more worthwhile to ask/contribute, hope you have a good day! </q co> </h3 >      slow down is kind of a blues so the melody will borrow those Ab's from F min but it probably usually won't so much hit F min directly. it's gonna borrow from Fmin when it's on that Bb7 chord. really you might say that blues tunes like this are said to be in the key of F7, but ironically this one actually probably never literally uses the A and Eb notes at the same time (that's the core twang ingredient in the actual F7 chord) ...... for some reason in my world, i find even if you want to express the sentiment of F7 over time, for some reason I almost never actually use the A and Eb notes at the same time. but there sure is a hell of a lot of interchange which allows me to bend the road around hitting those notes in close proximity to each other, over time. including borrowing even more on either side, such as those Ab's, or even Db's, or the other way i think there is a sort of Fmaj7 (E note) here and there, probably somewhere in the mids of the fax machine etc. Also i have a song under high consideration lately which is firmly affixed in minor not in a sad way, and you did get me thinking. so what you are saying is legit. uptown funk, stayin alive, havana, trillions and trillions of other songs are firmly based in a minor key and yet are not sad at all. they are "bad" (another example)</item>
